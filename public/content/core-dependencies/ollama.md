## What Is Ollama?

Ollama is an *optional* but powerful dependency that allows PiecesOS to run Large Language Models (LLMs) directly on your device instead of relying on cloud-based AI processing.

Unlike PiecesOS—which is required for all Pieces functionality—Ollama is only needed if you want to use local AI models with Pieces Copilot.

<Callout type="tip">
  Using Ollama for local generative AI is *a separate process* from how PiecesOS uses local, in-house LoRA models for processing data with the LTM-2 Engine.
</Callout>

## Why Use Ollama?

Ollama acts as a wrapper around `llama.cpp`, making local AI processing faster, more stable, and easier to use.

It simplifies model deployment and ensures compatibility with [Pieces for Developers’ supported LLMs](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/ollama/supported-models) and allows for new local models to be integrated soon after they are released.

Additionally, many developers and organizations prefer local LLMs over cloud-hosted models for reasons such as:

* **Stronger data security,** as it keeps proprietary code and sensitive queries 100% local.

* **Faster response times** with no network delays during generative AI processing and local inference.

* **Offline accessibility** for use even when no internet connection is present.

* **Enterprise compliance** so all AI queries remain within company-managed environments.

### How It Works

Ollama is integrated with PiecesOS to enable local modal inference and generative AI capabilities.

Here’s how Ollama works alongside PiecesOS:

* **Serves on-device LLMs**, reducing cloud dependency and enhancing privacy.

* **Automatically detects existing Ollama installations**, so if you’ve already installed it for other purposes, Pieces can use it without requiring a reinstallation.

* **Supports a curated set of models**, all using `Q4_K_S` quantization for performance optimization.

* **Ensures compatibility** with PiecesOS through minimum version requirements to avoid stability issues.

<Callout type="tip">
  Since Ollama is several GBs in size, it is **not installed by default**. Users must opt in during the PiecesOS setup process if they want local model support.
</Callout>

### Using Local vs Cloud Models

PiecesOS primarily uses cloud-based AI models for Pieces Copilot.

However, users who prefer on-device AI for speed, privacy, or offline access can install Ollama to enable local models.
