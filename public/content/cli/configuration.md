## Settings Overview

Below is a breakdown of each adjustable setting (preferences, behaviors, views, etc.) you can find in the Pieces CLI, broken down by section

**List Applications**

To see every application you’ve registered, run `list apps`. This prints a table of app names and IDs so you can verify which integrations are available.

**List Models**

Use `list models` to display all AI models you’ve configured for the `ask` command. The output shows each model’s name and index, and which is currently active.

**View Configuration**

Run `config` to print your current IDE selection for code editing.

**Edit Configuration**

Execute `config --editor <editorName>` to open your config file in the editor of your choice. Simply adjust values (for example, change `timeout: 10` to `timeout: 20`) and save—your changes take effect immediately.

**Login**

Authenticate with your Pieces Cloud account by running `login`. You’ll be prompted for credentials in a web browser; once you’re logged in, you can sync materials and access private resources in your [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/drive).

**Logout**

Use `logout` to clear your saved credentials and end your session. This is useful when switching accounts or working on a shared machine.

**Contribute**

Kick off a contribution workflow with `contribute`. You’ll be guided through describing your changes, and a pull-request template will open in your browser so you can submit improvements to the CLI.

**Install PiecesOS**

Run `install` to download and set up the [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os), which provides background services, like Pieces Drive, and a graphical dashboard for non-CLI related tasks.

**Open PiecesOS**

Use `open` to launch the desktop app or helper Applet. If it isn’t already running, this command starts the service and brings up the GUI.
