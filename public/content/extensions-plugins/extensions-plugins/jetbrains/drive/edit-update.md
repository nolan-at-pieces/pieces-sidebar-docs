## Actions from the Pieces Drive View

A tool menu with Pieces features will appear when you left-click on a saved snippet in the Pieces Drive. Some options relate to the [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot), while others handle [material management](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive) actions.

### Pieces Copilot Actions

To access the material management view, choose a snippet from Pieces Drive. You can select various Copilot-focused actions from here, as listed in the table below.

***

| `Add to Copilot Context` | Adds the snippet to the context of your existing Copilot Chat conversation.                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ask Copilot`            | This triggers the input modal, which lets you type a prompt directly into the field without changing your active file view. |
| `Insert at Cursor`       | Inserts the code snippet at the point of your cursor inside your active file.                                               |
| `Shareable Links`        | Shows shareable links that have been generated for that snippet, if applicable.                                             |

## Additional Tools while Editing

*Layers upon layers of functionality*—that's the aim of all Pieces for Developers plugins and extensions.

When you edit a snippet (find it in the Pieces Drive menu and click `Edit`), you can access all Pieces features, even though you're not in your main file view.

Instead, the `Edit` view *becomes* your main file, so you can [generate code comments, debug, add it to context, and more.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot)
