## Installation & Updating Fixes

You can find detailed instructions on updating PiecesOS and the Pieces Desktop App on your Linux device using the terminal.

Additionally, you can check your system's OS and hardware specifications to ensure they meet the minimum recommended requirements.

## Versions & Updates

Many issues can stem from running outdated versions of PiecesOS or the Pieces Desktop App on Linux.

### Updating PiecesOS

On Linux, PiecesOS and the Pieces Desktop App are distributed via snaps (for Ubuntu-based systems).

To update PiecesOS on Linux:

1. Run `snap info pieces-os` to check the current version of PiecesOS

2. Run `sudo snap refresh` to update PiecesOS if a newer version is available

### Updating the Pieces Desktop App

Similar to PiecesOS, you can update the Pieces Desktop App by:

1. Running `snap info pieces-for-developers` to check the current version

2. Running `sudo snap refresh` to apply any available updates

## Common Installation Issues

Official support is provided for **Ubuntu 22.04+ and Ubuntu-based distributions.** Other distributions may work but *aren’t guaranteed.*

### Checking Distribution Compatibility

Ensure you’re running a supported Ubuntu-based distribution.

If not, consider switching to a supported environment, as installation on non-Ubuntu distributions isn’t guaranteed.

### Updating Snapd

Snap-based installations require an up-to-date snap `daemon`:

* Run `sudo snap refresh` to ensure `snapd` and its packages are current

### Adjusting Graphics & Display Settings

If installation or UI issues persist, consider the following:

* **Switch Between X11 and Wayland:** Some applications may work better on one display protocol than the other. Try switching to X11 for compatibility or Wayland for newer features. You can usually select this at the login screen.

<Callout type="alert">
  The LTM-2 Engine is designed to work with the X11 Window Manager. Other Window Managers, such as Wayland, are *not compatible.* This means that long-term memory functionality with certain Linux Virtual Machines (VMs) is not possible at this time.
</Callout>

* **Update your GPU Drivers:** Ensure they are up to date. For NVIDIA, check for proprietary driver updates. AMD and Intel users should verify that their open-source drivers are up to date.

* **Optimize Graphics Configurations:** Use tools like `nvidia-settings`, `radeon-profile`, or similar utilities to adjust your GPU settings for better performance and stability.

These adjustments can resolve many graphical and display-related issues you may experience while using Pieces for Developers or PiecesOS.

## Checking System Information

You can verify your system’s hardware configuration and ensure it meets recommended specifications by running specific commands in your terminal.

### Checking CPU Information

To determine your CPU type and find other important information, type `lscpu` in your terminal and press `Enter`.

### Checking GPU Information

To determine your GPU type and find other important information, `lspci | grep -i vga` in your terminal and press `Enter`.

Confirm that your CPU, GPU, and memory resources are sufficient for running PiecesOS and local AI models (if applicable).

Click here for documentation on [what we recommend for minimum device specifications](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/cross-platform#hardware-recommendations) if you plan on utilizing a local LLM.

### Checking Ubuntu Version

If the Pieces Installer is not working as intended, you could have an outdated version of Ubuntu. The minimum Ubuntu version that Pieces will run on is **Ubuntu 18**.

To check what version of Ubuntu you’re running:

* Open the **Settings** on Ubuntu

* Locate the **System** section at the bottom of the left-hand side menu and click it

* Open the **About** section and locate the **Operating System** label

This section will will display your Ubuntu version information.

### Consulting Online Resources

If you encounter persistent installation issues, consult online forums or community guides related to snap and Ubuntu-specific troubleshooting steps.

## Restart & Retry

If you’ve updated components, checked hardware, and adjusted configurations without success, restart your machine and try again.
