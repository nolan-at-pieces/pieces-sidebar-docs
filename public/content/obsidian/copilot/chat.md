## Contextualized Chats

Using the `Pieces: Ask Copilot About Selection` command lets you interact with Copilot regarding specific text or code within your notes.

There are two ways to access this command:

### via Right-Click Menu

<Steps>
  <Step title="Highlight Text or Content">
    Select the text or excerpt that you want to query in your note.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Right-Click">
    Right-click on the highlighted text.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Command">
    Choose `Ask Copilot About Your Selection` from the context menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Question">
    Type your prompt in the text input field and press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### via Command Palette

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Command Palette">
    Use `⌘+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+p` (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette in Obsidian.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Command">
    Type and run `Pieces for Developers: Ask Copilot About Your Selection`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Question">
    Type your prompt in the text input field and press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux).
  </Step>
</Steps>

This approach is ideal for localized queries requiring **quick insights or guidance on a specific selection.**

## Adding Context to Copilot Chats

There are several individual items you can add as context to a chat, namely `Files`**,** `Folders`**,** `Snippets from the Pieces Drive`**,** `Websites`**,** and `Messages`**.**

This flexibility is particularly useful when the reference material you want to use isn’t directly accessible in Obsidian or when you want to compartmentalize context, avoiding overlap between files or projects.

To do this, select the **Starred Message Icon** in the bottom-left corner of your Copilot Chat window, openable from the Obsidian sidebar.

Click the **Starred Message Icon,** then add whatever context items you need.

### Adding Code Snippets

You can paste snippets of code as a code block inside any Copilot Chat by clicking the `{ }` icon inside the chat window, then pasting in your code.

This is useful for bringing in code that isn’t present immediately in the active file as context, or for comparisons and suggestions.

### Extracting Code from Screenshots

You can also extract code from screenshots directly from the Copilot chat menu by selecting `Extract Code from Screenshot`, selecting the desired screenshot from your **Finder** (macOS) or **File Explorer** (Windows/Linux) menu, and confirming.

Pieces Copilot will then scan the screenshot and generate the code captured from the image into the chat. You can copy, insert it at your cursor, save it as a snippet, and more.

### Adding Folders from File Explorer

Suppose you right-click on a folder in Obsidian’s file explorer. In that case, you’ll see the following options: `Pieces: Add Vault to Copilot Context` and `Pieces: Add File to Copilot Context`, so you can take any folder or file in the project you’re working in and immediately have the Pieces Copilot interact with it.

## Improving Code Consistency & Standardization

The Pieces Copilot helps improve code quality by identifying inconsistencies and providing actionable suggestions for standardization.

### Naming Inconsistencies

Suppose functions across your workspace use inconsistent naming patterns (e.g., `authenticateUser` in `authHandler.go` vs. `retrieveUserProfile `in `userHandler.go`). In that case, can suggest adopting a standardized naming convention for better readability and maintainability, like this:

```c
func authenticateUser(ctx context.Context, credentials Credentials) (User, error) {
    if credentials.Username == "" || credentials.Password == "" {
        return User{}, errors.New("missing credentials")
    }
}
```

### Inconsistent Error Handling

If error-handling strategies differ across files (e.g., structured errors in `authService.go` vs. inconsistent handling in `userService.go`), Pieces Copilot can help unify the approach:

```c
func LoginUser(credentials Credentials) (string, error) {
    token, err := authenticate(credentials)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("login failed: %w", err)
    }
    return token, nil
}
```
