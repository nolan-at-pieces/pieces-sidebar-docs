## Real-Time Snippet Streaming

Every product within the Pieces Suite utilizes [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os) to gather information regarding the context of your snippets.

When you modify a snippet in the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop">Pieces for Developers Desktop App</a>—like changing its name or description, tags, or any other metadata—those updates are automatically shown in your [Pieces Web Extension](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/get-started#supported-browsers) without the need for refreshing.

<Callout type="tip">
  If your snippets aren’t updating immediately, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/troubleshooting) for instructions on refreshing your snippet list.
