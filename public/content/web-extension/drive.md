## Materials in Pieces Drive

With Pieces Drive and the Pieces Web Extension, you can save all types of code and text snippets.

You can easily find, edit, and reuse them anytime, anywhere, and in any way you need.

Here are some examples of developer materials you can reuse:

***

| `Logging Utilities`    | A helper function for detailed server-side logging with timestamps and error levels.                        | Speeds up debugging and monitoring by inserting reliable logging methods.   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Validation Functions` | A function to validate JSON payloads or form inputs before submission.                                      | Ensures data integrity with reusable, thoroughly tested validation logic.   |
| `API Integration Code` | Prewritten `axios` code for making GET or POST requests, complete with error handling and response parsing. | Reduces repetitive work when integrating RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints. |
| `Component Templates`  | A React functional component template with basic hooks and styling setup.                                   | Provides a consistent starting point for building new components.           |
| `Database Queries`     | A MongoDB query to retrieve active user data filtered by last login.                                        | Streamlines database tasks by reusing optimized query patterns              |

## Boosting Productivity with Snippet Management

The Pieces Drive connects you with your notes and project files, allowing you to focus on what matters—building great software—while offering tools for efficient code reuse.

* **Improved Productivity**: Concentrate on solving new problems instead of revisiting old ones by quickly accessing and reusing code snippets.

* **Contextual Awareness**: Saved materials contain metadata, descriptions, and links to relevant searches, helping you remember their origin, purpose, and best usage scenarios.

* **Code Standardization**: Sharing best practices and reusable components ensures consistent coding practices and conventions across teams and projects.

By using the Pieces Drive, you can capture and manage your snippets to streamline daily tasks and enhance your workflow in several ways:

### Save & Organize

Easily [save a function, script, or piece of boilerplate](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/save-snippets) directly from the tool menu.

These snippets are saved to your personal Pieces Drive and enriched with context, metadata, and tags, making them easy to find whenever needed.

To save a snippet in your browser, highlight a section of text or code, right-click, and select `Pieces: Save Selection`.

On websites with code blocks, Pieces will add a `Copy and Save` option below the block, saving the snippet to your Pieces Drive.

### Search & Reuse

You can directly [search your collection of saved materials in Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/search-reuse) from your browser to quickly find snippets by keyword or context.

To search, open the **Search Bar** from the Pieces Web extension sidebar in the Pieces Drive tab.

Type your query into the search bar and press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to view the search results.

Any related snippets will appear in the results list.

From there, you can press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to view your snippet, complete with all its saved context, neatly displayed inside the editor.

### Sharing

Share your snippets from within the Pieces Web Extension, even if the person you’re sending it to doesn’t use Pieces or have a Pieces for Developers account.

  Sharing useful code snippets can help overcome productivity hurdles, especially if a co-developer is new to the project or is a junior developer.

  For instance, a teammate working on server monitoring can use your shared script to automate daily tasks without extra setup.

  These shared links also keep their [original enriched metadata](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet), including tags, descriptions, and other details, making it easier for teammates to understand and use the code.
</Card>

To share a snippet from your browser, simply find a code block you want to share and click the `Share` quick action below it.

You can also locate a snippet in your Pieces Drive, right click it, and select `Generate Shareable Link`.

This generates a link you can share with teammates, ensuring easy access to your reusable code.

## Use Cases

With the Pieces Web Extension, [your snippets become a powerful library](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) of reusable code. You can organize, search, edit, and share them across your projects, all within the Pieces Drive.

Here are some examples of how you can use them:

### Reusable Code Snippets for Data Science

If you often work on complex data science projects, algorithm design, or data processing pipelines, you can save reusable code snippets in your Pieces Drive.

These snippets can be easily imported into your browser for documenting workflows, analyzing results, and iterating on solutions in future projects.

```python

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  

data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  
 
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler  
scaler = MinMaxScaler()  
data[['feature1', 'feature2']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['feature1', 'feature2']])  

print(data.describe())  
```

### Code Snippet Documentation

If you frequently research projects that involve monitoring file system changes, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/save-snippets) that does exactly that, allowing you to import it over to your IDE for usage:

```go
func watchFileChanges(path string) {
	watcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer watcher.Close()

	err = watcher.Add(path)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	for {
		select {
		case event := <-watcher.Events:
			if event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {
				fmt.Println("Modified file:", event.Name)
			}
		case err := <-watcher.Errors:
			fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		}
	}
}
```
