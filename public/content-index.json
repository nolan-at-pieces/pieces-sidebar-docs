This prints a table of app names and IDs so you can verify which integrations are available.\n\n**List Models**\n\nUse `list models` to display all AI models you’ve configured for the `ask` command. The output shows each model’s name and index, and which is currently active.\n\n**View Configuration**\n\nRun `config` to print your current IDE selection for code editing.\n\n**Edit Configuration**\n\nExecute `config --editor <editorName>` to open your config file in the editor of your choice. Simply adjust values (for example, change `timeout: 10` to `timeout: 20`) and save—your changes take effect immediately.\n\n**Login**\n\nAuthenticate with your Pieces Cloud account by running `login`. You’ll be prompted for credentials in a web browser; once you’re logged in, you can sync materials and access private resources in your [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/drive).\n\n**Logout**\n\nUse `logout` to clear your saved credentials and end your session. This is useful when switching accounts or working on a shared machine.\n\n**Contribute**\n\nKick off a contribution workflow with `contribute`. You’ll be guided through describing your changes, and a pull-request template will open in your browser so you can submit improvements to the CLI.\n\n**Install PiecesOS**\n\nRun `install` to download and set up the [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os), which provides background services, like Pieces Drive, and a graphical dashboard for non-CLI related tasks.\n\n**Open PiecesOS**\n\nUse `open` to launch the desktop app or helper Applet. If it isn’t already running, this command starts the service and brings up the GUI.\n\n***\n\nFor additional support resources, check out our [troubleshooting guide.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/troubleshooting)",

The one highlighted in green is where new questions go by default.\n\n* `chat`: Display the messages in your current conversation.\n\n* `chat <number>`: Switch to conversation `<number>` and show its messages.\n\nUse these flags with your `chat` command to manage conversations as you go:\n\n* `chat --new`, `chat -n`: Create a new conversation and switch to it.\n\n* `chat --delete`, `chat -d`: Delete the conversation you’re currently viewing.\n\n* `chat --rename [name]`, `chat -r [name]`: Rename the conversation you’re viewing. If you don’t provide `[name]`, the assistant will suggest one.\n\n[Read more about what commands are available in the Pieces CLI](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/commands).\n\n## Contextualized Chats\n\nYou can narrow Copilot’s focus by feeding it specific materials or files when you ask a question.\n\n### via Material Index\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open a Terminal\">\n    Opening a terminal on your device depends on your platform: Open your OS’ search bar and enter `terminal`(macOS/Linux) or `CMD`(Windows).\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"List your materials\">\n    Run `pieces list` to view all saved materials and note the **index** of the one you need.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Ask with a Material\">\n    Use the `-m` flag and that index when you ask: `pieces ask \"Explain the data model here\" -m 4`\n\n    Pieces Copilot will load material #4 as context.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/pieces_context_chat.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### via File Path\n\nUse a folder of specific file as context for Pieces Copilot by initiating the conversation at a specified path.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Select Your File or Folder\">\n    Decide which file (or directory) you want Copilot to reference.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Open a Terminal\">\n    Opening a terminal on your device depends on your platform: Open your OS’ search bar and enter `terminal`(macOS/Linux) or `CMD`(Windows).\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Ask with a File\">\n    Use the `-f` flag and the path, `pieces ask \"How does this component render?\" -f src/components/Button.jsx`.\n\n    Pieces Copilot will read that file before answering.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Provide Multiple Contexts\">\n    Mix flags to supply more than one source `pieces ask \"Compare this code to the design spec\" -m 2 -f design/specs.md`.\n\n    Copilot loads material #2 and `specs.md` before generating its response.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/adding_file.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Pieces MCP\n\nThe Pieces MCP offers several useful commands within the Pieces CLI, from setting up the MCP to learning more about it. Discover the different commands:\n\n### Setup\n\nAutomatically sets up MCP for VS Code, Goose, or Cursor.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Enter MCP Command\">\n    Within the Pieces CLI, enter `mcp setup` this will open up a new MCP setup menu.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Select MCP Platform\">\n    In the new window, select one of the three options that appear:\n\n    * VS Code\n\n    * Goose\n\n    * Cursor\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/selecting_mcp_option.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n    After selecting the environment you plan to set up Pieces MCP with, you’ll be prompted with the next set of questions.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Select Workspace\">\n    The new menu will have you select a workspace:\n\n    * `User Settings` — Make the MCP available in any project you work on within VS Code.\n\n    * `Workspace Settings` — Save the MCP locally to the current project you’re working on.\n\n    When you select the workspace you want to set up, Pieces CLI will automatically add the configuration for you and guide you through using Pieces MCP within the platform you chose.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### List\n\nThe `mcp list` command displays the current implementations of Pieces MCP on your development platforms.\n\nCurrently, the Pieces CLI supports integration with [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/github-copilot), [Goose](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/goose), and [Cursor](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/cursor).\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/mcp_list.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Docs\n\nThe `mcp docs` command displays all of the [mcp documentation](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started) correlated with the supported development environments with the Pieces CLI and Pieces MCP.\n\n### Repair\n\nThe `mcp repair` command checks how the Pieces MCP is set up in the platforms supported by Pieces CLI.\n\nIf it finds any issues, it will automatically fix them and ask you to type `y` for yes or `n` for no. Then, press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to confirm your choice.\n\n### Status\n\nRunning `mcp status` within the Pieces CLI will automatically check all implemented platforms to make sure the Pieces MCP implementation is running correctly.\n\nIf it finds that an implementation is broken, it will ask if you want to auto-repair the MCP server.\n\nType `y` for yes or `n` for no, and press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to confirm your choice.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/finish_setup_mcp.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Improving Code Consistency & Standardization\n\nThe Pieces Copilot enhances code quality by identifying inconsistencies and providing practical suggestions for standardization.\n\n### Naming Inconsistencies\n\nSuppose functions across your workspace use inconsistent naming patterns (e.g., `authenticateUser` in `authHandler.go` vs. `retrieveUserProfile` in `userHandler.go`).\n\nIn that case, Pieces Copilot can suggest adopting a standardized naming convention for better readability and maintainability, like this:\n\n```c\nfunc authenticateUser(ctx context.Context, credentials Credentials) (User, error) {\n    if credentials.Username == \"\" || credentials.Password == \"\" {\n        return User{}, errors.New(\"missing credentials\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Inconsistent Error Handling\n\nIf error-handling strategies differ across files (e.g., structured errors in `authService.go` vs. inconsistent handling in `userService.go`), Pieces Copilot can help unify the approach:\n\n```c\nfunc LoginUser(credentials Credentials) (string, error) {\n    token, err := authenticate(credentials)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"login failed: %w\", err)\n    }\n    return token, nil\n}\n```",

These snippets are stored in your personal Pieces Drive and include context, metadata, and tags for easy retrieval.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_drive/_MAIN/saved_snippet_displayed.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nTo save a code snippet, copy a snippet from a website or your IDE, go over to the Pieces CLI, and type `create`. If you’re not in a running Pieces CLI, you can type `pieces create` and enter the command.\n\nThis will automatically grab whatever is in your clipboard and save it to your Pieces Drive.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_drive/_MAIN/pieces_create.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Search & Reuse\n\nYou can search your collection of saved materials directly from your terminal. This lets you quickly find snippets using keywords or context.\n\nTo search, you can access the `search` action inside of the Pieces CLI.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_drive/_MAIN/pieces_search_interm.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nFrom within Pieces CLI you can enter `search “query”` to do a basic search. If you’re not within the Pieces CLI, you can enter `pieces search “query”`.\n\nYou can optionally append `--mode` followed by the search method you’d like:\n\n* `ncs`: Does a neural code search for your query.\n\n* `fts`: Does a full-text search for your query\n\nI.e., `pieces search “query” --mode fts` will use the full-text search on your database using your query.\n\n### Edit & Update\n\nYour snippets can change as your project grows, as you adapt to new project needs, or when you switch to new files in your codebase.\n\nIn the `pieces save` command of the **Pieces Drive** within Pieces Copilot, open your saved snippets, update the code to meet current needs, and save the revised version back to Pieces.\n\nThis keeps your library up-to-date, relevant, and aligned with your project's progress. Enhancing your materials makes them more efficient, which benefits you in the long run.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/pieces_drive/_MAIN/edit_command.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Reusable Scheduling Functions\n\nImagine you’re frequently working on projects that involve scheduling tasks at regular intervals.\n\nInstead of rewriting the same logic for each new project, [save an evergreen snippet to your Pieces Drive.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/drive/save-snippets#save-snippets)\n\nThis allows you to reuse a well-crafted scheduling function across multiple applications, that is useful in a variety of scenarios:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\n// A reusable function to schedule tasks at a specified interval\nfunc scheduleTask(interval time.Duration, task func()) {\n\tticker := time.NewTicker(interval)\n\tdefer ticker.Stop()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase <-ticker.C:\n\t\t\ttask()\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### File System Monitoring\n\nSuppose you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes. In that case, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets) that does precisely that, using generic and reusable naming conventions:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n\n// A reusable function to monitor file system changes\nfunc watchFileChanges(path string) {\n\twatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer watcher.Close()\n\n\terr = watcher.Add(path)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase event := <-watcher.Events:\n\t\t\tif event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Modified file:\", event.Name)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tcase err := <-watcher.Errors:\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## **Additional Snippet Scenarios**\n\nCheck out more scenarios and use cases for Pieces Drive to see how the Pieces CLI can enhance your workflow.\n\n***\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Testing Framework Templates\">\n    Streamline your testing process by saving snippets of your frequently used testing functions or unit test templates.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Command-Line Utilities\">\n    Save command-line instructions as snippets to easily access deployment commands, Docker setups, and other critical terminal operations.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Error Handling & Logging\">\n    You can also save standard logging functions or error-handling snippets that can be reused in different applications, promoting consistent error management.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Quickly Create New Projects\">\n    Import saved setup scripts, configuration files, and commonly used dependencies to set up new projects and maintain consistency quickly.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>",

[Learn more about PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os).\n\n* **Python 3.xx:** <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\">Python</a> is required to be installed on your development machine.\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  PiecesOS must be installed to use the Pieces CLI and ensure it works properly.\n\n  We also suggest using the Pieces for Developers Desktop App for better functionality.\n</Callout>\n\n## Installing the Pieces CLI\n\nFollow the instructions below to install the Pieces CLI and any required dependencies.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Install Python\">\n    Head to [Python’s website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the version that best suits your environment.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/get_started/python_download.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n    After downloading the Python version 3.xx, you will be guided through the installation process. Follow their steps until Python is installed.\n\n    <Callout type=\"tip\">\n      Make sure to allow Python to be added to your environment variables, so it’s executable via terminal.\n    </Callout>\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Install Pieces CLI\">\n    Once Python is installed, its dependency `pip` is automatically installed. We will use this to install Pieces CLI.\n\n    Open a terminal on your device and type `pip install pieces-cli`, or if you prefer to use Conda, type `conda install pieces-cli`. As long as Python is set up correctly, Pieces CLI will install.\n\n    If you’re on macOS, you can optionally install Pieces CLI via **Homebrew**:\n\n    * `homebrew install pieces-cli`\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Verify Installation\">\n    To verify a successful installation of the Pieces CLI, you can type `pieces version` within your terminal. This will display your Pieces OS and Pieces CLI versions.\n\n    <Callout type=\"alert\">\n      If you receive **'pieces' is not recognized as an internal or external command,** you can run pieces with `py -m pieces $command`.\n    </Callout>\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Run Pieces CLI\">\n    To run Pieces CLI, you can enter the command `pieces run`. This will launch you into the Pieces CLI and make it so you don’t have to prefix with `pieces`.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Setting Up PiecesOS\n\nTo use the Pieces CLI, you must install [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os) on your working environment.\n\nClick the download buttons or follow the set-up instructions below for your operating system:\n\n<get-started-install />\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  For enhanced security and better system integration, we recommend installing the `.appinstaller` package over the `.exe` installer. The `.appinstaller` package operates in a containerized environment, providing additional security benefits.\n</Callout>\n\n## Updating\n\nFollow the steps below to update the Pieces CLI.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open a Terminal\">\n    Opening a terminal on your device depends on your platform: Open your OS’ search bar and enter `terminal` (macOS/Linux) or `CMD` (Windows).\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Update Pieces CLI\">\n    In the open terminal, type `pip install pieces-cli -U`. This will update Pieces CLI with no other interaction needed. If you’re using Conda, type `conda update pieces-cli` to update Pieces CLI.\n\n    <Callout type=\"alert\">\n      On Linux or macOS, running the command with sudo permissions may be required. To do this, run `sudo pip install pieces-cli -U`.\n    </Callout>\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/get_started/update_pieces_cli.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Onboarding\n\nThe Pieces CLI offers a walkthrough to guide you through the steps of saving your first material and introduces you to the Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2), enabling you to make the most of the Pieces CLI.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/get_started/onboarding_first_step.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Save Your First Material\n\nThe onboarding will start by providing you with a snippet to copy to your clipboard. Highlight the code and press `⌘+c` (macOS) or `ctrl+c` (Windows/Linux).\n\nAfter copying the snippet, you can select any key on your keyboard to proceed.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  If you haven’t copied the snippet, Pieces won’t allow you to paste.\n</Callout>\n\nAfter pressing any key, Pieces will prompt you to type `pieces create` into your terminal. With the snippet still copied, enter `pieces create`, and Pieces will ask if you want to save the snippet.\n\nType `y` and press `return`(macOS) or `enter`(Windows/Linux) to confirm to save the snippet to your [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/drive).\n\n### Finding your Saved Materials\n\nIn this step, you'll learn how to open your saved materials. Start by typing `pieces list` in your terminal and pressing `enter`.\n\nThis will display a list of all your saved materials. You can navigate through them using the arrow keys on your keyboard.\n\nSelect the material you're highlighting by pressing `return`(macOS) or `enter`(Windows/Linux).\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/get_started/selecting_pieces_list_onboarding.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Start a Session\n\nAfter selecting a snippet, Pieces CLI will boot you out to the terminal to prompt you to start a new session.\n\nTyping `pieces run` will open a new session, allowing you to enter Pieces commands without prefixing with `pieces`.\n\nAfter the session, you can type exit and press `return`(macOS) or `enter`(Windows/Linux) to return to the onboarding.\n\n### Chat with the Copilot\n\nThis section will walk you through how to ask [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli/copilot) its first question. You can begin in your terminal by typing `pieces ask 'How to print I love Pieces CLI in Python and Java'` and pressing `return`(macOS) or `enter`(Windows/Linux).\n\nAfter typing your question and running the command, Pieces Copilot will quickly generate and display the best response for your query.\n\nIt will then prompt you to do it with the Pieces CLI running by typing `pieces run` entering the command and then entering `ask $question`, `$question` being the question you’d like to ask Pieces Copilot.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  Your question must be encased in quotations or Pieces won’t capture your full question.\n</Callout>\n\n### More Resources\n\nYour feedback is **vital** to us. This onboarding step will prompt you to enter `pieces feedback` where you can optionally open the GitHub discussion board related to Pieces CLI to leave helpful feedback.\n\nIf you enter `y` it will open the GitHub discussion board in a new tab in your browser, otherwise it will skip this step.\n\nAfter completing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/cli-agent/discussions/194\">feedback</a>, Pieces will prompt you to type `pieces contribute` and then ask if you’d like to open the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/cli-agent\">source code for Pieces CLI on GitHub</a> to improve it. You can optionally say yes by entering `y`; otherwise, enter `n`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/get_started/pieces_feedback_onboarding.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nFollow the steps below to uninstall the Pieces CLI.\n\nIf you also want to uninstall PiecesOS, [follow these steps](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/manual-installation#uninstalling-piecesos).\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open a Terminal\">\n    Opening a terminal on your device depends on your platform: Open your OS’ search bar and enter `terminal`(macOS/Linux) or `CMD`(Windows).\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Run Uninstall Command\">\n    If you installed Pieces CLI using PIP, you can type `pip uninstall pieces-cli` to remove the CLI. If you used Conda, you can type `conda remove pieces-cli`.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/cli_assets/get_started/pip_uninstall.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>",

Opening a terminal on your device depends on your platform: Open your OS's search bar and enter `terminal` for macOS/Linux or `CMD` for Windows. Open the recommendation.\n\n    2. In the new terminal, type: `pip install pieces-cli -U` to update the Pieces CLI with Python’s PIP package manager.\n  </TabItem>\n\n  <TabItem title=\"Conda\">\n    1. To open a terminal on your device, search for a terminal on macOS/Linux or CMD on Windows, then select the suggested option.\n\n    2. In the newly opened terminal, enter: `conda update pieces-cli`. Conda will install the newest version of Pieces CLI.\n  </TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nAn outdated version of PiecesOS might be causing the problems. Be sure to update it, too. When you start PiecesOS, it will prompt you to update.\n\nIf not, you can [reinstall it to fix any remaining issues](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/manual-installation#manual-download--installation).\n\n## Restart your System After Updates\n\nIf you've recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces CLI, restart your system. This can help apply any system variables that may have been set up during installation.\n\nContact the [Pieces support team](https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-vscode) if the issue persists.\n\n## Pieces-Specific Fixes\n\nMake sure to check the health and status of PiecesOS. Review the items below if you are having problems with Pieces Drive or Pieces Copilot within the Pieces CLI.\n\n### Check PiecesOS Status\n\nCheck to make sure PiecesOS is running.\n\n<pos-check />\n\n*PiecesOS must be running for the Pieces CLI to work.*\n\n### Refreshing Copilot Chats\n\nYou may need to restart or refresh the Pieces Copilot chat, especially if you’re using a cloud LLM and disconnect from WiFi.\n\nThese scenarios can occasionally cause the LLM to ‘hang’—to appear as if generating a response but eventually timing out, entering an infinite response loop, or experiencing other issues.\n\nTo do this, exit the current chat by pressing `⌘+c` (macOS) or `ctrl+c` (Windows/Linux) to force stop the active chat. Then you can re-enter the `ask “query”` command.",

Refer to the installation guide for the list of prerequisites.\n\n* **Reinstall:** Uninstall any previous version of Ollama and perform a clean installation.\n\n* **Network Issues:** If downloading fails, check your internet connection or proxy settings.\n\n* **Error Messages:** Look for specific error messages during installation and consult the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md\">Ollama FAQ</a> or official installation troubleshooting docs for guidance.\n\n### Performance Problems\n\nWhen running PiecesOS and using local models for generative AI use, you may experience slow response times or high CPU and RAM usage that causes your overall system to slow down.\n\nYou may need to:\n\n* **Switch to Cloud Models:** You may need to acquire or switch over to a device with more RAM, a newer CPU with more cores, or a dedicated GPU with more VRAM.\n\n* **Use a Lighter Model:** You may need to use a parameterized or more lightweight model if available.\n\n* **Cut Down Instances:** If you are running multiple instances or flooding the LLM with queries and prompts, reduce the number of concurrent processes.\n\n## Using Local Models\n\nOlder devices, regardless of operating system, may struggle to meet the hardware demands of heavy-duty LLMs, even with Ollama's streamlined setup.\n\n### Minimum System Requirements\n\nLocal models demand more from your system than their cloud-hosted counterparts.\n\nTo ensure a stable, responsive experience—make sure your device fits these general minimum device specifications, pulled from Ollama documentation and other experience-tested public sources.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Operating System\">\n    Ollama is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux devices—but you need to make sure your operating system is running at the correct minimum version to avoid compatibility issues.\n\n    * **macOS:** macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later.\n\n    * **Windows:** Windows 10 or later.\n\n    * **Linux:** Ubuntu 18.04 or later.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"RAM\">\n    Your system should have a minimum amount of RAM depending on the local model you’re trying to run.\n\n    More RAM may further improve performance and reduce bottlenecks.\n\n    * **3B Models:** 8GB of RAM\n\n    * **7B Models:** 16GB of RAM\n\n    * **13B Models:** 32GB of RAM\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"CPU\">\n    If your system doesn’t have a dedicated or otherwise capable GPU, running a CPU-tuned model may be in your best interests.\n\n    * **Recommended:** Any modern CPU with at least 4 cores.\n\n    * **13B Models:** Any modern CPU with at least 8 cores.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"GPU\">\n    While you don’t need a GPU to run a local Ollama model as long as the LLM is CPU-tuned, a GPU can significantly speed up inference and the training of custom models.\n\n    * **Recommended:** Any modern GPU with at least 6GB of VRAM.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Storage Space\">\n    Local large language models can occupy significant disk space, so ensure you have enough capacity for both the core installation and any custom models you plan to download or train.\n\n    * **Minimum:** At least 12GB of free storage space for installing Ollama and other base models.\n\n    * **Additional Storage:** Required for larger models that have additional dependencies\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Choosing the Right Model\n\nPick a model that fits your system's capabilities and performance limits, especially if you're using an older or less powerful device.\n\n* **Lightweight Models:** Choose smaller or **quantized models** if you're using older hardware or have limited VRAM. Quantized models use less memory, making them easier to run without greatly affecting output quality for general tasks.\n\n* **GPU-Tuned Models:** If you have a powerful GPU with enough VRAM, GPU-accelerated models usually run faster and deliver results more efficiently.\n\n* **CPU-Tuned Models:** If you don't have a dedicated GPU or have low GPU memory, CPU-tuned models are a good alternative. Though slower, they can still offer reliable performance.\n\n### Local Model Crashing\n\nIf you encounter 'hanging' or crashing issues when trying to run Pieces with a local LLM, it might be due to your system's hardware.\n\nInsufficient system resources like RAM or VRAM can cause hiccups, slowdowns, and other glitches.\n\nHere are some troubleshooting options:\n\n1. **Check Hardware:** Ensure you have enough RAM, VRAM, and CPU capacity as recommended by the model.\n\n2. **Update Drivers:** Use `vulkaninfo` (or a similar tool) to check for GPU or Vulkan-related errors if you have a Vulkan-based GPU. Update your GPU drivers if you find compatibility issues.\n\n3. **Model Switching:** If you experience crashes or slowdowns, try switching to a less resource-intensive local model. Reducing complexity can help stabilize performance.\n\nIf you've tried all these troubleshooting steps but still face crashes, hanging, or other instabilities, you may need to switch to a cloud-based LLM.\n\n### Vulkan-based GPUs\n\nNVIDIA and AMD both use the Vulkan API framework in their GPUs, but there are known issues when using Vulkan GPUs for AI and LLM-focused tasks. For instance, a corrupted or outdated Vulkan API can lead to crashes.\n\nIf you encounter this problem, check Vulkan health in your terminal or command line by scanning for errors or warning messages. If any issues are found, **update your GPU drivers.**\n\n### Checking Vulkan\n\nTo check your Vulkan health status, run `vulkaninfo` in your terminal or command line and look for errors or warnings.\n\n### Updating GPU Drivers\n\nIf issues are detected, update your GPU drivers to ensure Vulkan compatibility and stability.",

In those cases, data is handled according to the provider’s privacy policy—not ours.\n\nThis architecture puts you in full control of your data, simplifies backup and restore, and minimizes your exposure to risk.\n\nCloud features are not required, are opt-in only, are isolated per user (`<your-subdomain>.pieces.cloud`).\n\nWe never use your data to train third-party models. You can delete your entire database, logs, and backups at any time by removing the `com.pieces.os` folder—more on that below.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  We’re **SOC 2 Type II** certified and never use your private data to train models.\n</Callout>\n\n## Where your Database Lives\n\nPieces stores all snippet metadata, embeddings, tags, and workflow context captured by LTM-2 in a single folder inside the `com.pieces` directory on your machine.\n\n| **Platform** | **Default path\\***                             |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| *macOS*      | `/Users/<username>/Library/com.pieces.os/`     |\n| *Windows*    | `C:/Users/<username>/Documents/com.pieces.os/` |\n| *Linux*      | `/home/<username>/.local/share/com.pieces.os/` |\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Replace `<username>` with your OS account name.\n</Callout>\n\nInside `com.pieces.os`, you’ll see `production`, which contains several folders that store broken down LTM-2 context and the rest of your data.\n\nYou are free to **copy, compress,** or **relocate** the entire `production` folder—for example, to sync via OneDrive or to migrate to another machine.\n\n### Finding your Logs\n\nWhen you open a GitHub issue or contact **Pieces Support**, attaching the most recent logs helps us diagnose problems in *minutes* instead of *hours*.\n\n| **Platform** | **Log Directory**                                                     |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| *macOS*      | `/Users/<username>/Library/com.pieces.os/production/support/logs/`    |\n| *Windows*    | `C:/Users/<username>/Documents/com.pieces.os/production/support/logs` |\n| *Linux*      | `/home/<username>/.local/share/com.pieces.os/logs/`                   |\n\nLogs rotate daily and are timestamped (`log-05062025`).\n\nZip the latest two or three files and drag them into your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues\">GitHub issue</a> or Discord DM with our engineers.\n\n## Backup, Restore, or Reset\n\nThere are several options to backup, restore or reset your database from within the `com.pieces.os` folder.\n\n| **Task**                                           | **Quick Steps**                                                                                                                                              |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| *Create a Manual Backup*                           | Quit all Pieces apps. Copy the entire `com.pieces.*` folder to your backup location, such as a USB drive, NAS, or cloud storage.                             |\n| *Restore Database on a New Machine*                | Install Pieces OS. Replace the newly created `com.pieces.*` folder with your backup.

key ways: by (1) supplying the essential components of the Pieces infrastructure and supporting various processes, and (2) powering standalone Pieces plugins and extensions when used without the Pieces Desktop App.\n\nThis ‘brain’ is required to enable the 3 fundamental features of the Pieces development experience.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/core_dependencies_assets/figma_mockups/piecesos_bridging_all_products.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### How Does PiecesOS Work?\n\nPowered by PiecesOS, the Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) Engine tracks your development and workflow context using the Pieces Drive, allowing you to import and export materials as needed.\n\nThen, with Pieces Copilot, you can use cloud-based or local LLMs through Ollama to start chats that include the context you need.\n\nThis way, all AI-powered elements work together to enhance your context and creativity, especially when you need a memory boost.\n\n## Fundamental Components\n\nUsing the Pieces Desktop App or a Pieces plugin or extension for your favorite IDE requires PiecesOS, as it is a required dependency for memory and context preservation, storing and accessing materials, and interacting with generative AI.\n\n## LTM-2\n\nThe **Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) Engine** is a powerful evolution of the original LTM system, designed to store and surface workflow context from up to **nine months** in the past.\n\n<Card title=\"Want a Sneak Peak?\" image=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1745425239243/516a20d3-2664-4f22-9b32-f0f14924a87a.webp\">\n  Here’s a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tsavo.hashnode.dev/temporal-nano-model-breakthrough\">quick read on some of the nano-models</a> we develop that layer into the data retrieval pipeline for LTM-2 and the coming *LTM-2.5*\n</Card>\n\nBy combining automatic “roll-ups” with flexible “memories” browsing, LTM-2 ensures you don’t lose track of code, discussions, or references—even if you return to a project weeks or months later.\n\nThese workflow summaries can be found within the [Workstream Activities](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/workstream-activity) view in the [Pieces Desktop App](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop).\n\n***\n\n*Pieces Copilot with LTM-2 Context —* Pieces Desktop App\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734028488469/d128a760-7e91-4dbf-8cfc-e7fc257488b7.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp&q=75\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n***\n\n### Grounded Assistance\n\nLong-Term Memory is designed to boost developer productivity by providing assistance that’s temporally grounded within the concrete context of your actual workflow, allowing the Pieces Copilot to better understand your development process over time.\n\nThis helps it offer more relevant and timely responses to queries, as it has a *local database* of information to work from.\n\nSince LTM has a local database of information to work from, it can offer **relevant, timely** responses to your queries:\n\n* Recall details from older tasks or code reviews without requiring you to re-describe them.\n\n* Understand ongoing projects more holistically, anticipate next steps, and offer suggestions aligned with your actual workflow.\n\n### How Context is Captured\n\nUnder the hood, LTM monitors your workflow at the operating system level, capturing data from:\n\n* **IDEs** (e.g., changes, commits, open files)\n\n* **Browsers** (e.g., opened tabs, reference links)\n\n* **Collaboration tools** (e.g., messaging apps, file-sharing platforms)\n\nLTM (through PiecesOS) extends your ability to [enable or disable specific sources](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#quick-menu-actions) for data capture—this way, you can decide exactly what gets tracked and stored, providing flexibility if you have sensitive or personal workflows.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  The data captured by LTM is processed and stored entirely on your device, so you don’t need to worry about privacy and security—[which you can read more about here.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/privacy-security-your-data)\n</Callout>\n\n### Less Context Switching\n\nTraditionally, AI tools require you to restate your environment—what project you’re working on, the code you just wrote, or the documentation you’ve referenced.\n\nHowever, with LTM-2’s temporal grounding, you have:\n\n* **Reduced Manual Input**: No more duplicating the same context or re-pasting large code blocks.\n\n* **Enhanced Continuity**: Your interactions flow seamlessly from one coding session to the next, letting you pick up exactly where you left off.\n\n* **Intuitive Interactions**: Ask questions like “What was I working on with John last week?” or “How do I fix that same CocoaPods issue from last Tuesday?”\n\nPieces Copilot can reference stored LTM data to give you real-time, **context-aware** answers.\n\n### Use Cases\n\nLearn [how to use Pieces Long-Term Memory](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-context) to capture information from your browser and retrieve it later with a simple prompt to the Pieces Copilot:\n\n1. **Capture Website Content for Later Reference:** Automatically store information from webpages or browser tabs you’re viewing, without needing to copy-paste anything.\n\n2. **Recall Important Details with a Single Prompt:** [Ask the Pieces Copilot to retrieve content it previously saw](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/copilot-with-context#prompt-pieces-copilot)—like secret messages, documentation, or key details from web apps.\n\n3. **Track and Summarize Research Across Multiple Sites:** Let Pieces Long-Term Memory log what you’ve read across different websites and use that context to generate summaries or next steps.\n\n4. **Simplify Context Sharing with Teammates:** Capture context once, then have the Pieces Copilot summarize it or export it for others—great for asynchronous collaboration or hand-offs.\n\n5. **Bridge Gaps Between Tools:** Pull in information from any browser-based tool or document viewer, and make it accessible directly inside Pieces Copilot chats.\n\n<Card title=\"Pieces + MCP\" image=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1744828766164/e0d722d2-f173-48e4-8de1-ec13d00769a3.png\">\n  Here’s another use case for you—try combining the power of Pieces Long-Term Memory with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with the brand new [Pieces MCP.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started)\n</Card>\n\n## MCP Support\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open framework that lets Large Language Models (LLMs) access relevant data from your device.\n\nCreated by Anthropic, MCP removes the need for custom integrations by enabling tools like Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor to request and receive detailed, structured context.\n\n[MCP is fully supported within the Pieces ecosystem](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started) and acts as the link between PiecesOS and external applications that need real-time, local context.\n\n***\n\n*Pieces MCP —> Cursor*\n\n<Image

alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n***\n\n## Workstream Activity\n\nIn the [Pieces Desktop App](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop), the 2nd-generation LTM comes with an incredibly powerful feature called [Workstream Activity](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/workstream-activity).\n\nThe Workstream Activity view is a dedicated interface in the Pieces Desktop App that provides a continuous snapshot of your recent tasks, discussions, and code or document reviews, captured by the **Long-Term Memory (LTM-2)** **Engine.**\n\nEvery 20 minutes, LTM generates a *roll-up* that summarizes your workflow context for that period, highlighting details such as major tasks, key decisions, and follow-up actions.\n\n***\n\n*Reviewing a LTM Roll-up —* Pieces Desktop App\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740758250747/b98dc42a-21f8-4282-b45b-4b1d7afe8573.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n***\n\nIn addition to offering a timeline of roll-ups, the Workstream Activity view [lets you search for keywords, open references or links, and even launch Pieces Copilot Chats](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/workstream-activity#interacting-with-roll-ups) directly from a summarized entry.\n\nBy surfacing relevant data right when you need it, the Workstream Activity feature [eliminates the frustration of recounting your background](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-prompting/workstream-activity) or re-pasting massive prompts every time you want AI assistance—empowering you to focus on high-value work instead.\n\n### Use Cases\n\nExplore real-world scenarios that highlight how Workstream Activities can make collaboration easy, enhance product documentation, and simplify project context sharing:\n\n1. **Capture and Share Project Contexts:** Filter activities by project keyword to create a history of actions and conversations. Share as text, markdown, or use Pieces Copilot for a summary.\n\n2. **Generate Documentation from Workflow:** Use Workstream Activity Rollups to log your process and export a searchable summary with links and context.\n\n3. **Build Standup Reports or PR Summaries:** Log ticket reviews, create an activity with links and context, and use Copilot to summarize it for updates.\n\n4. **Collaborate Asynchronously with Markdown Snapshots:** Export activities as markdown for teammates to load into their Pieces Copilot with full context.\n\n5. **Use Filtered Snapshots in Copilot Chats:** Filter activities by keyword or task and inject them into a chat for insights and documentation help.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  This means you can revisit precisely what you worked on in the past, even if you step away from a project for *weeks* or *months.*\n\n  Check out some of the [additional use cases for the Workstream Activity view.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-prompting/workstream-activity)\n</Callout>\n\n### On-Device Data Storage\n\nAll data captured by the LTM is stored locally on your device. It never leaves your device or becomes accessible to anyone, including the Pieces team, unless you choose to share it.\n\nLTM applies on-device machine learning algorithms to filter out sensitive information and secrets, maintaining high levels of performance, security, and privacy.\n\nFor advanced components that require blended processing, user preferences can be set to leverage a cloud-powered Large Language Model as the Copilot’s runtime. \n\n## Pieces Drive\n\nPieces Drive is an intelligent and interactive material manager baked into PiecesOS that allows you to save, manage, and share important developer resources such as notes, useful code snippets, links, and more within your personal local repository.\n\nYou can view, edit, reuse, and share these materials via Pieces Shareable Links from this repository. \n\n***\n\n*Viewing Saved Materials with Pieces Drive —* Pieces Desktop App\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734026181487/e947ec50-4346-49f1-a967-62b218aafc47.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp&q=75\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n***\n\n### Multi-Tool Integration\n\nWith PiecesOS, you can use Pieces Drive in tools like [Obsidian](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian) and [Raycast](https://docs.pieces.app/products/raycast), as well as your favorite code editors, such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains\">IntelliJ</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code\">Visual Studio Code</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime\">Sublime Text</a>.\n\nYou can also view and adjust metadata saved with your materials in the Applet View of Pieces plugins or the Pieces Desktop App.\n\n### AI-Powered Enrichment\n\nWhen you save code or other useful materials to Pieces Drive, AI automatically enriches them with a wide variety of useful metadata.\n\nThe enrichment process, powered by on-device ML models, provides:\n\n* annotations\n\n* anchors\n\n* shareable links\n\n* related links\n\n* related people\n\n* suggested searches\n\n* tags\n\n* sensitive information\n\n* date created\n\n* source of origin\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  Pieces will also identify and flag any sensitive information, like API keys or personal data, and flag this information under **Sensitive Information.**\n</Callout>\n\n## Pieces Copilot\n\nLike Pieces Drive, Pieces Copilot can be found nested within Pieces plugins and extensions or the Pieces Desktop App.\n\nIt can generate code, answer questions, add code documentation, and serve as the bridge between you and your workflow context, as captured by the LTM-2.\n\n***\n\n*Pieces Copilot for Code Generation —* Pieces Desktop App\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734028533289/f37f7075-f2d2-4a99-b948-c23fd70e7257.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp&q=75\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n***\n\n### Introducing Context to Chats\n\nIf you encounter a scenario where you need to recall a specific URL to a Firestore database that was used during a live demo with another coworker, you can use Pieces Copilot (with LTM enabled) to recall that *exact link.*\n\n### Understanding Code\n\nPieces Copilot helps you comprehend complex code snippets by providing explanations, detailing how specific functions work, and suggesting alternative implementations for that code.\n\nTry asking it alternative ways to handle logging, or more robust methods of error handling—give it an entire file, an entire *project,* or just a function.\n\n### Code Generation\n\nBy specifying your requirements for a function or script, Pieces Copilot can generate code that seamlessly fits into your active file.\n\nUse Pieces Copilot and Pieces Drive together to generate boilerplate code or adjust a function. Then, save it to the Pieces Drive with enriched metadata for future use, saving time.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nDebugging, checking logs, and handling errors are often the toughest parts of coding. But with Pieces Copilot, you can debug code thoroughly using the Pieces Desktop App or your preferred plugin.\n\nContext-based debugging is powerful because generative AI, whether cloud-based or local, can understand code semantics beyond what's visible and within the project's scope to find solutions and fixes.\n\nYou might even be able to finally center that `div`—seriously, we’ve actually done it.",

It shows certain views as 'suggested' based on the task you're working on or sorts them by how often you use them.\n\n## Dynamic View-Based Actions\n\nThe **Power Menu** in Pieces for Developers is a dynamic command palette.\n\nWhen you press the Power Menu hotkey or open it from the app interface, you’ll see different actions *depending on which view or section of the app you’re currently in*.\n\nFor example:\n\n* **Pieces Drive View:** You’ll see commands related to creating, editing, or managing snippets (e.g., “Create New Material,” “Optimize Snippet,” etc.).\n\n* **Pieces Copilot View:** You’ll see commands focused on AI-driven interactions (e.g., “Ask Copilot,” “Analyze this Snippet,” etc.).\n\n* **Application & Cloud / Global Context:** Some commands (e.g., “Check for Updates,” “Manage Accounts & Cloud Integrations,” “Go to Settings”) appear in multiple views or from a global context.\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  If you search for a command in the Power Menu and you’re *not* in the view where that command is valid, **it will not appear** in your search results.\n</Callout>\n\n### Pieces Copilot\n\nYou can find lots of saved material and generative AI-focused actions when accessing the Power Menu from the Pieces Copilot view.\n\n***\n\n| **Command**                                 | **Description**

App’s main view.\n\nThen, navigate to either of the two sections:\n\n1. **Copilot Chats:** Manage the Pieces Copilot runtime, accent color, LTM defaults, and more.\n\n2. **Machine Learning**: Configure auto-enrichment and control how Pieces handles cloud vs. local ML processing.\n\n## Copilot Chats\n\nWithin the *Pieces Copilot Chats* section, you can adjust your Copilot’s behavior, manage the underlying AI model, and clear chat history as needed.\n\n### Manage LLM Runtime\n\nThe `Manage Copilot LLM Runtime` option allows you to switch between available AI models (e.g., “GPT-4o Mini”) or configure any new runtimes provided by Pieces—both *cloud* and *local.*\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/settings_with_mcp_update/copilot_and_ml/copilot_chats.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"false\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Switching models can be useful if you want to try different levels of quality or speed.\n</Callout>\n\n### Reset Active Runtime\n\nUse the `Hard-Reset Active Runtime` button if the Pieces Copilot stops generating responses or behaves unexpectedly.\n\nThis effectively *restarts* the AI model so that it can begin processing requests again.\n\n### Accent Color\n\nThe **Accent Color** sets a highlight color for specific elements, like text bubbles and other view-based UI elements within the [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/copilot) view or other views.\n\nFor more information about customizing your UI colors, visit our [Aesthetics & Layouts](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/configuration/aesthetics-layout) documentation.\n\n### Default LTM Behavior\n\nEnable or disable `Use Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) Context by Default` to control whether Pieces Copilot automatically references your recent workflow context as captured by the LTM.\n\nTurning this off means the AI will respond without leveraging your workflow context unless manually enabled when starting a new Pieces Copilot Chat.\n\n### Delete Chats\n\nClick `Delete All Copilot Chats` to remove all chat history stored on your device.\n\nThis is useful if you'd like to start a new conversation or eliminate old ones that are no longer needed.\n\n## Machine Learning\n\nThe *Machine Learning* section governs how Pieces enriches your saved materials, controls local vs. cloud-based ML resources, and manages on-device LTM.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/settings_with_mcp_update/copilot_and_ml/machine_learning.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"false\" />\n\n### Auto-Enrichment Behavior\n\n`Auto-Enrichment` settings let you control how much metadata is automatically attached to code snippets and other saved materials.\n\nPieces can add *tags, related websites, hints,* and *references to people* (e.g., authors of code) at varying levels of detail: `No Enriched Data`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  By default, all auto-generated metadata settings are set to `Medium`.\n\n  Lowering these levels may be beneficial if you prefer minimal automatic annotations or need to limit external lookups.\n</Callout>\n\n### Machine Learning (ML) Processing\n\nUnder *ML Processing*, you can fine-tune how Pieces uses local and cloud resources to power various functions and processes within the Pieces software experience.\n\n### Enrichment Mode\n\nYou can select whether or not Pieces utilizes cloud or local models, or a mix of both, for saved material enrichment.\n\n* `Blended`: Uses both local and cloud resources for material enrichment.\n\n* `Local`: Restricts enrichment to on-device analysis and generation *only*—the best case scenario for privacy-forward workflows.\n\n* `Cloud`: Optimized for speed, Pieces sends your material data to Pieces Cloud for processing.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Selecting the mode that best fits your security and performance needs ensures that Pieces processes your snippets in the most efficient or privacy-conscious way possible.\n</Callout>\n\n### LTM-2 Engine\n\nPieces employs an on-device **Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) Engine** to capture recent contexts, usage patterns, and snippet details for more intelligent Copilot suggestions.\n\nConfigurable behaviors include:\n\n* `On`: LTM is fully active and enabled by default and on start-up.\n\n* `Off`: Disables LTM entirely.\n\n* `Pause`: Provides options for halting the LTM for 15 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, or 24 hours.\n\nWhile *paused* or *off,* Pieces Copilot won’t use your workflow context to inform suggestions or provide more accurate information in generative AI responses.\n\n[You can read more about the LTM-2 Engine here.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2)\n\n### Clearing LTM-2 Data\n\nClick the `Trash` icon next to `Clear Long-Term Memory Engine Data` to remove any persisted context that LTM has gathered over time.",

IDEs through dedicated plugins and extensions.\n\nWhen you use Pieces Copilot within an IDE, you experience a similar chat interface with environments using the Pieces Applet view, complete with context-aware suggestions tailored to your current project.\n\nThe settings and configurations (such as LTM context and model preferences) remain consistent with the Desktop App, ensuring a seamless transition between environments.\n\n### Shared Conversation Threads\n\nThe Copilot experience supports *cross-threading.*\n\nThis means that your chat history and contextual data can be shared between the Desktop App and other environments.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_copilot/pieces_copilot_in_multiple_environments/copilot_in_environment_demo_part_one.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nWhether you start a conversation in the Desktop App and later continue it in an IDE, your context and settings persist—making for a fluid, uninterrupted workflow.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_copilot/pieces_copilot_in_multiple_environments/copilot_in_environment_demo_part_two.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## The Pieces User Experience\n\nPieces Copilot is designed to maintain a consistent core experience—offering essential features like chat history, context management, and LLM configuration—across all environments.\n\n### Flutter-Supported Environments\n\nIn platforms such as JetBrains, Visual Studio Code, and the Pieces Web Extension, Pieces leverages a dedicated Flutter-based *Applet* view which provides a standardized user experience for interacting with Pieces Copilot and the Pieces Drive.\n\n***\n\n*Pieces Web Extension*\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_copilot/pieces_copilot_in_multiple_environments/pieces_web_extension_copilot_applet.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n***\n\n### Custom UI Environments\n\nFor environments that do not support Flutter applets (e.g., Sublime Text or the CLI), Pieces Copilot adapts with a custom interface tailored to the specific platform.\n\nAlthough the visual presentation differs, all core features remain available, so the learning curve is as minimal as possible while still providing Pieces functionalities.\n\n***\n\n*Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin*\n\n<Image

Pieces Drive streamlines this process by offering automatic enrichment and intuitive editing features.\n\n## Editing your Saved Materials\n\nThere are several types of saved metadata and captured context to make use of, edit, repurpose, and delete—if you want.\n\nBelow are the primary methods for managing your materials once they’re in the Pieces Drive:\n\n### Saved Materials List\n\nLocated on the left sidebar, the **Saved Materials List** displays each of your snippets with titles and notes:\n\n* **Auto-Generated Titles**: Pieces instantly names each snippet based on its contents, so you can see a human-readable summary at a glance.\n\n* **Annotations:** An automatically-generated description of the saved material’s purpose and function.\n\nClick any item to load it in the main detail pane. This is where you’ll see the code or text, along with a wealth of automatically generated context (tags, annotations, etc.).\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_drive/enrichment_and_metadata/gifs/opening_from_saved_materials_list.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Renaming and Reclassifying\n\nIn the detail view, locate the three-dot **Quick Menu** to reveal actions for customizing your snippet:\n\n* `Rename`: Override the auto-generated title with something that better fits your naming conventions.\n\n* `Reclassify`: If Pieces incorrectly detects the code’s language or you’d prefer to classify it differently, you can manually select a new language (e.g., reclassifying JavaScript as TypeScript).\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_drive/enrichment_and_metadata/reclassifying_code_snippet.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Managing Tags\n\nTags are a powerful organizational tool. Pieces automatically generates tags based on the snippet’s contents, but you can refine or add your own.\n\nFrom the **Quick Menu** or in the **Captured Context** panel, click `Manage Tags` to type new tags or remove existing ones.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Group snippets by frameworks (“React,” “Express”), projects (“Client A,” “Side Project”), or problem domains (“API calls,” “Data Structures”).\n</Callout>\n\n### Annotations\n\nAnnotations act like descriptive notes or documentation entries attached to your snippet.\n\nThey’re especially useful if:\n\n* **Multiple Developers Share the Same Snippet**: Add clarifications, usage examples, or important disclaimers.\n\n* **You Want Version Notes**: Document changes or reasons you created a new snippet in the first place.\n\n### Sensitive Information\n\nIf you import a saved material that contains API keys or credentials, Pieces may automatically assign them the **Sensitive Information** tag.\n\nPieces prevents accidental leakage by warning you when you generate a shareable link, so you’ve got a heads-up before you share the link with others.\n\nIf something isn’t automatically detected, you can still mark something as *sensitive* manually to add an extra layer of privacy for materials th\n\n* **Warning Before Sharing**: Pieces prevents accidental leakage by warning you when you generate a shareable link.\n\n* **Manual Entry**: You can also mark something as sensitive if it’s not automatically detected. This adds an extra layer of privacy for your team or organization.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_drive/enrichment_and_metadata/gifs/manually_adding_sensitive_info_to_snippets.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Anchors & Related People\n\nPieces automatically connects the dots between origin location (in terms of files) and related people who may have contributed into the code, and saves it alongside each material.\n\n* `Anchors`: If you want to track exactly where a snippet originated—like a specific file path, repository, or a web link—you can set Anchors in the snippet’s context panel.\n\n* `Related People`: Attach team members or collaborators’ names/emails to a snippet, creating a record of who contributed to its creation or usage.\n\n## Using the Quick Menu\n\nFrom within the main detail view of a snippet, the **Quick Menu** (often represented by three vertical dots or an ellipsis icon) consolidates the most important snippet actions:\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  The **Quick Menu** is essentially your control center for material maintenance.\n</Callout>\n\n1. `Duplicate`: Quickly create a second version of the snippet, either exact or transformed.\n\n2. `Related Links`: See or add relevant URLs (like documentation pages).\n\n3. `Manage Annotations`: Add new notes or edit existing ones.\n\n4. `Sensitive Information`: Review or add any recognized keys, tokens, or secrets.\n\n5. `Delete`: Permanently remove the snippet if it’s no longer needed.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_drive/enrichment_and_metadata/gifs/using_quick_menu_annotations_links_demo.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />",

collaborate other developers on your team.\n\n## Sharing\n\nOne of the most convenient ways to collaborate or showcase work is by sending a code snippet to your team, friends, or the broader developer community.\n\nPieces Drive makes this process dirt-simple using *shareable links*, which allow others to view your snippet and its related metadata in a consistent, Pieces-branded web interface—even if they don’t have Pieces installed. \n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_drive/sharing/shared_snippet_demo_1.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nThese links preserve the snippet’s code, syntax highlighting, tags, annotations, and other contextual data—this way, recipients see not just lines of text, but the snippet’s *entire backstory and classification.*\n\n## Generating Shareable Links\n\nThere are two ways to generate shareable links for saved materials in your Pieces Drive.\n\n### via Quick Menu\n\nStart by opening the material you want in the main *Detail View* of Pieces Drive.\n\nFind and click the **three-dot Quick Menu** (usually in the top-right corner of the snippet's section).\n\nThen, choose `Generate Shareable Link` or `Shareable Link`—if it's your first time creating a link for that snippet, Pieces will make a new unique URL.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_drive/sharing/gifs/sharing_via_quick_menu.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  If you’ve already generated a link for this material before, it exists in the cloud—so you can just copy the shareable link to your clipboard.\n</Callout>\n\n### via Keyboard Shortcut\n\nYou can toggle a different shareable link modal that provides you with the previously-generated link or generates a new one by using keyboard shortcuts—`cmd+L` (macOS) or `ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux).\n\nIf you want to see how the snippet appears, simply paste the link into a web browser.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_drive/sharing/material_in_browser_demo_2.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nYou’ll find a code view, syntax highlighting, any relevant tags, annotations, and a snippet description—just like in Pieces Drive.\n\n## Security & Sensitive Data\n\n<mark>Pieces Drive takes security seriously.</mark>\n\nWhen you begin generating a shareable link, Pieces is designed to initiate and allow specific behaviors pertaining to privacy and security:\n\n* **Automatic Detection of Secrets**: If the code snippet contains credentials or tokens that Pieces recognizes (API keys, client secrets, etc.), you’ll *receive a warning* before proceeding.\n\n* **Sensitive Info Management**: You can explicitly mark or unmark certain strings as sensitive within the material’s context panel.\n\n* **User Confirmation**: Pieces prompts you to confirm that you’re okay sharing the snippet as-is or suggests that you *remove or redact sensitive* *portions* first.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nPieces may not catch everything, so you should *always be careful* of what code materials you generate links for, and *with whom you share them.*\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Review for Secrets\">\n    Even if Pieces doesn’t automatically flag something, it’s good practice to check for any private tokens, database credentials, or other sensitive data.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Create ‘Safe’ Versions\">\n    If you need to show code logic without actual credentials, consider duplicating your snippet, removing the secrets, and then sharing that sanitized version.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Boilerplate or Readability Transformation\">\n    If you just want to demonstrate a concept, consider using the [Transforming Code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive/transforming-code) features to create a boilerplate or more readable version for sharing.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Managing Existing Links\n\nOnce a snippet has a shareable link, Pieces Drive helps you track and modify it.\n\nRevisit the **Quick Menu** for the saved material, then look under the first section titled *Shareable Link* and click `Manage`.\n\nThis will give you access to the shareable link in an input field, the option to generate a GitHub Gist based on that code, and then 3 further options:\n\n1. `Open in Browser`**:** Automatically opens the code snippet’s shareable link in your default browser.\n\n2. `Refresh Link`**:** Refreshes the link if you’ve made changes to the saved material itself, so you can always share an up-to-date version.\n\n3. `Revoke Link`**:** Similar to *deleting a material,* this button essentially ‘deletes’ the shared link, taking the saved material off of the cloud so that it cannot be accessed outside of your Pieces Drive.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/pieces_drive/sharing/managing_existing_links_menu.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Use Cases & Workflows\n\nCheck out the workflow use cases below for ideas or inspiration on how to share code using the Pieces system.\n\n***\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Team Collaboration\">\n    Shareable links are excellent for quick internal reviews. Instead of copying raw code into a Slack channel, send a link so your teammates get the snippet’s annotations, tags, and formatting intact.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Open-Source Contributions\">\n    If you maintain an open-source library, shareable links can demonstrate bug fixes or new features without requiring others to install Pieces. They’ll see a snippet rendered in a neat web interface.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Code Reviews & Documentation\">\n    Use shareable links to document specific sections of a codebase. Project managers or QA engineers can open the link, comment on the snippet, and refer back to it without rummaging through version control logs.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Demo or Client Presentations\">\n    For freelancers or consultants, a shareable link offers a tidy way to showcase code examples to clients. They see professional formatting and can test the snippet themselves if they have access to a browser-based environment.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>",

Try switching to X11 for compatibility or Wayland for newer features. You can usually select this at the login screen.\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  The LTM-2 Engine is designed to work with the X11 Window Manager. Other Window Managers, such as Wayland, are *not compatible.* This means that long-term memory functionality with certain Linux Virtual Machines (VMs) is not possible at this time.\n</Callout>\n\n* **Update your GPU Drivers:** Ensure they are up to date. For NVIDIA, check for proprietary driver updates. AMD and Intel users should verify that their open-source drivers are up to date.\n\n* **Optimize Graphics Configurations:** Use tools like `nvidia-settings`, `radeon-profile`, or similar utilities to adjust your GPU settings for better performance and stability.\n\nThese adjustments can resolve many graphical and display-related issues you may experience while using Pieces for Developers.\n\n## Checking System Information\n\nVerify your system's hardware configuration and ensure it meets the recommended specifications by running specific commands in your terminal.\n\n### Checking CPU Information\n\nTo determine your CPU type and find other important information, type `lscpu` in your terminal and press `Enter`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/meet_pieces_assets/meet_pieces/troubleshooting/linux/lscpu_UBUNTU.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Checking GPU Information\n\nTo determine your GPU type and find other important information, `lspci | grep -i vga` in your terminal and press `Enter`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/meet_pieces_assets/meet_pieces/troubleshooting/linux/lscpi_UBUNTU.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nConfirm that your CPU, GPU, and memory resources are sufficient for running PiecesOS and local AI models, if applicable.\n\n### Checking Ubuntu Version\n\nIf the Pieces Installer is not working as intended, you could have an outdated version of Ubuntu. The minimum Ubuntu version that Pieces will run on is **Ubuntu 22.04 or later**.\n\nTo check what version of Ubuntu you’re running:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open Settings\">\n    Open the **Settings** on Ubuntu by clicking the *options bar* in the top right\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Find the System Section\">\n    Locate the **System** section at the bottom of the left-hand side menu and click it\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Open the About Section\">\n    Open the **About** section and locate the **Operating System** label\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThis section will display your Ubuntu version information.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/meet_pieces_assets/meet_pieces/troubleshooting/linux/settings_about_system.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Consulting Online Resources\n\nIf you encounter persistent installation issues, consult online forums or community guides related to snap and Ubuntu-specific troubleshooting steps.\n\n## Restart & Retry\n\nIf you've updated components, checked the hardware, and adjusted configurations without success, try restarting your machine and then try again.\n\nIf the problem persists, please open a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues\">**GitHub issue**</a> for further assistance or book a call with our engineers.",

Launch Windows Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell as *administrator.*\n\n  2. In the terminal, type `winget install “Pieces for Developers”` and press `enter`.\n\n  You may be prompted to enter `Y` or `N` to agree or disagree with the terms of use when installing the Pieces Desktop App—type and enter `Y` to proceed with the installation.\n</Card>\n\n## Versions & Updates\n\nMany issues can stem from out-of-date plugins, extensions, or the Desktop App itself.\n\n### Updating the Pieces Desktop App\n\nUpdating the Pieces Desktop App on Windows (and macOS) can be done directly within the application:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the Pieces Desktop App\">\n    Press the `Windows Icon` and search for Pieces Desktop, open it\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Locate the User Icon\">\n    Click the `User Icon` to the right of the **Search Bar** at the top of the main app view\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Check for Updates\">\n    Select `Check for Desktop App Updates`\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Update Pieces for Developers\">\n    If prompted, click `Download Update` to install available updates.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/meet_pieces_assets/meet_pieces/troubleshooting/windows/windows_check_pfd_for_updates.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nYou can also select `Check for PiecesOS Updates` from the same menu as an alternative to doing so from the PiecesOS system window in your taskbar.\n\n## Common Installation Issues\n\nWindows users may encounter installation issues for various reasons, such as out-of-date OS components or incomplete dependencies.\n\n### Checking for Windows Updates\n\nBefore installing, ensure your Windows system is fully updated:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open your Settings\">\n    Click the `Start` button, then select `Settings`.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Find your Updates\">\n    Click `Windows Update` in the sidebar options.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Install any Updates\">\n    Install any pending updates and restart your computer.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Updating the Microsoft Store & App Installer\n\nIf you downloaded Pieces software through the Microsoft Store and are experiencing issues with the marketplace interface, try updating the app.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the Microsoft Store\">\n    Press the `Windows` button and search for the **Microsoft Store**, open it.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Find the Library updates\">\n    Click on `Library `to check for available updates.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Update all recommendations\">\n    Update the Microsoft Store and the App Installer if prompted.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Reinstall Pieces Suite\">\n    Now, you can retry installing Pieces Suite.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Issues Launching PiecesOS\n\nSome users who have enabled Controlled Folder Access (CFA) as a security measure may receive a notification that Pieces is attempting to bypass this security wall.\n\nTo work around this issue, you will need to *add the executable path for PiecesOS* to your allowlist.\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  The reason PiecesOS fails to launch when CFA is enabled is that the executable path for the PiecesOS application writes data to your Documents folder.\n\n  CFA disables and blocks any request to modify files (in this case, writing & saving data), so PiecesOS is unable to launch itself.\n</Callout>\n\nKeep in mind that this path references the specific PiecesOS version, and so will change over time as long as you continue to update the software. You can also disable CFA as a security measure if you do not require it as part of an enterprise scenario or for any other reason.\n\nPiecesOS uses vision processing to ingest context from foreground applications horizontally.\n\nTo decide which apps PiecesOS has access to, you can [easily enable and disable specific sources from the Long-Term Memory Access Control](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#long-term-memory-access-control) panel.\n\n## Checking Hardware Specifications\n\nYou may need to check your system's specifications if you continue to experience issue[s, especially when trying to use local LLM](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#long-term-memory-access-control)s.\n\nTo check your device specifications on Windows:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the Windows search\">\n    Press the `Windows` key on your keyboard or the `Windows Icon` in the task bar.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Open Run\">\n    Type **“run”** and press `enter`.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Find Dxdiag\">\n    Type `dxdiag` and press `enter` or click the blue `OK` button.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThe **System** tab displays your processor, the number of CPU cores, and memory (RAM), while the **Display** tab lists your GPU, its manufacturer (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, Intel), and the available video memory (VRAM).\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/meet_pieces_assets/meet_pieces/troubleshooting/windows/windows_checking_hardware_specs.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Checking Windows Version\n\nIf the Pieces Installer isn't working properly, you might be using an outdated version of Windows. Pieces requires at least **Windows 10 20H0 or higher**.\n\nTo find out your Windows version, press the `Windows` and `R` keys together, type **winver** in the pop-up window, and press `Enter`.\n\nA new window will open called *About Windows*, which will display your current Windows version.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  If this doesn't work, you’re likely using a Windows version lower than Windows 10.\n</Callout>\n\n### Restart the Pieces Desktop App\n\nAfter trying any of the fixes above, it’s recommended that you restart your desktop and the Pieces Desktop App.\n\nThis ensures all caches are clean and the computer is refreshed.\n\nIf the problem persists, please open a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues\">**GitHub issue**</a> for further assistance or book a call with our engineers.",

Each roll-up is timestamped (e.g., “9:04 AM – 9:14 AM”) with a descriptive title (such as “Documentation & LTM-2 Prep”).\n\n2. **Roll-Up Details (Right Panel)**: Selecting a roll-up displays its sections and bullet points, including embedded links, references, or code snippet IDs.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/workstream_activity/new_workstream_activity_media/ltm_rollup_demo_screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) Engine\n\nLong-Term Memory is an advanced memory agent that captures your workflow context at repeated intervals and preserves it for up to *nine months*.\n\nInstead of starting fresh with every AI query, you can use LTM-2’s persistent memory to pick up any past conversation, code snippet, or link you’ve encountered.\n\nVisit our [Core Dependencies documentation](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies) read more about LTM.\n\n### LTM Roll-Ups\n\nEach *roll-up* is a one-page summary that includes information and specific sections, such as:\n\n* **Core Tasks & Projects**: A concise, but rich overview of projects, tasks or specific initiatives you’ve worked on—including problems and solutions (and how you came to that solution).\n\n* **Key Decisions & Discussions**: Important conversations or choices you made, mentioning with whom you had discussions or meetings or who shared critical details that had implications on your workflow.\n\n* **Documents & Code Reviewed**: References to any files, articles, or snippets you accessed, often deep-linked with clickable URLs (where applicable).\n\n* **Follow-Up Actions**: Unfinished items, suggestions for next steps, and reminders.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/workstream_activity/new_workstream_activity_media/gifs/open_all_4_different_rollups.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Interacting with LTM Roll-Ups\n\nEach roll-up offers multiple interaction points:\n\n* `Start Copilot Chat`: Immediately open a Pieces Copilot Chat session scoped to that roll-up’s context, eliminating the need to re-explain your background or goals.\n\n* `Copy` / `Download`: Export the roll-up as plain text or Markdown, letting you archive or share your summary outside of Pieces.\n\n* `Deep Links`: Open references directly in your browser. If the roll-up mentions a specific blog or document, you can jump straight to it from within Pieces.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/workstream_activity/new_workstream_activity_media/gifs/start_chat_from_copilot.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  If you remember that a teammate shared a solution link last month, you can locate that exact snippet, conversation, or link by searching the relevant keyword in Workstream Activity.\n</Callout>\n\n### Generating LTM Rollups\n\nIf your workflow context falls outside the default 30-minute roll-up window, you can generate a manual Workstream Rollup instead.\n\nThis is especially useful when you want to capture a broader time range—like **Today** or **This Afternoon**—which might span from 12:00 P.M. to 4:28 P.M., for example.\n\nCreating a roll-up across a wider time frame offers a more comprehensive view of your recent work and contextual activity. It’s a great way to zoom out and get a high-level snapshot of what’s been accomplished, especially when shorter intervals don’t provide enough detail.\n\nTo do this, click the white `plus` icon at the bottom left of the **Workstream Activities** view.\n\nThis opens up a *Time Range Selection* menu, which allows you to generate a summary based on a wide variety of time ranges:\n\n| **Range**              | **Example**                          |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| *Just Now*             | 4:35PM → 4:36 PM                     |\n| *Last Couple Minutes*  | 4:33 PM → 4:35 PM                    |\n| *Within the Last Hour* | 3:36PM → 4:33 PM                     |\n| *Around Lunch*         | 12:00 PM → 1:00 PM                   |\n| *Yesterday Afternoon*  | Yesterday 12:00PM → 5:00PM           |\n| *Yesterday Morning*    | Yesterday 5:00AM → 12:00 PM          |\n| *This Month*           | April 1, 12:00AM → April 17, 4:36 PM |\n\n… and many more. In total, there are *31 time ranges* to select from to best fit your use case.\n\nThen, select your desired time ranges, and click the `green checkmark` icon to generate the summary.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/workstream_activity/on_demand_rollup_summary.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"false\" />\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWorkstream Activity turns your daily work into a rich, queryable memory—so you never have to waste time re-explaining, re-documenting, or retracing your steps.\n\n<Card title=\"Why use the Workstream Activities feature?\" image=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743105695482/2e6005ea-3c80-4105-a983-7680b3dd380d.png\">\n  The Workstream Activity feature centralizes your workflow context, tackling a major productivity blocker in AI-assisted development—*short-term memory.*\n\n  It eliminates the need to repeat information to an AI assistant, ensures project continuity, provides a powerful search for past discussions or documents, and allows for flexible exports to share or store roll-ups.\n</Card>\n\nWith support from the LTM-2 engine, it becomes easy to search, share, and summarize critical moments from your workflow.\n\nHere are some practical ways to use it:\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Create Context Packs for Onboarding New Team Members\">\n    Filter and export roll-ups related to a specific project or time range, and then share them with new hires so they can instantly understand decisions, architecture, and open tasks, without the need for lengthy handoffs.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Build AI-Ready Summaries for Async Standups and Check-Ins\">\n    Instead of writing updates from scratch, turn a roll-up into a formatted summary or paste it into Pieces Copilot for a clean, human-readable update.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Generate Internal Documentation from Real Workflows\">\n    Use LTM summaries as the base for internal docs or knowledge bases. Each roll-up captures exactly what was discussed, reviewed, or built—no guesswork needed afterward.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Recover Forgotten Context After a Break\">\n    If you’ve been away from a project for a few days (or weeks), scroll back through Workstream Activity to instantly recall what you were doing, what was pending, and what resources were relevant.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Audit Past Decisions and Review Rationale\">\n    Return to a past roll-up to see why a decision was made, who was involved, and what options were discussed—perfect for retrospectives or incident reviews.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Track Research and Learning Progress Over Time\">\n    Whether you’re exploring new tech, debugging a complex problem, or reviewing articles, your LTM-2 roll-ups capture the learning trail so you can build on it later—or share it with others.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\nWant to keep reading?\n\nCheck out this quick guide for more use cases, featuring in-depth, real-world scenarios on [using the Workstream Activities view.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-prompting/workstream-activity)\n\n### Privacy & Source Control\n\n<mark>Your data is yours to manage.</mark>\n\nAt any time, even after a summary has been generated, you can disable sources from which LTM captures workflow data. Since LTM is available for use outside of the Pieces Desktop App, there are two locations from which you can make these changes.\n\nIn the Workstream Activity view, there is an LTM Access Control modal designated by a grid-like icon—clicking this opens the modal, where you can toggle or un-toggle data capture from specific sources.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/workstream_activity/new_workstream_activity_media/ltm_pfd_access_control.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nIn the PiecesOS task bar window, you can [disable any sources you don’t wish to capture](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#quick-menu-actions) (e.g., personal browsing activity or data from messaging applications) through the LTM Access Control panel.\n\nEvents gathered from disabled sources will be *removed* from your roll-ups so they don’t appear in Workstream Activity or Pieces Copilot Chats.",

can be found within Pieces extensions and plugins and PiecesOS—the **LTM-2 Engine, Pieces Copilot, and Pieces Drive.**\n\nWith the Pieces Desktop App, you have access to dedicated views for the context captured by Long-Term Memory and the new Workstream Activity feature, Pieces Copilot, and Pieces Drive.\n\nIf you know what you’re after, jump to our [documentation on the different navigation views.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/navigation)\n\n## Core Features\n\nThere are three core components of Pieces that are intelligently integrated to minimize context switching and improve productivity in your daily workflow.\n\n### LTM & Workstream Activity\n\nKeep track of your workflow so you can access stored context from yesterday, last week, or even *last month*—whenever you need it.\n\nImagine what you could do if you could always recall past solutions, find specific links that were lost to your browser history, or remember what so-and-so said in that one Slack channel about that new staging release?\n\n[The Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) ](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2)<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2\">engine</a> ensures that *nothing* slips through the cracks.\n\nThe new, incredibly powerful [Workstream Activity](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/workstream-activity) feature provides a sleek UI for interacting with saved data from up to **9 months ago** in an easily digestible *LTM Roll-Up* format, allowing you to start conversations with that context or copy and download it.\n\n<Image

Open the command palette using `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux) and enter `Ask About File`.\n\nOnce you've entered your question, the Pieces Copilot will analyze the file's context to deliver precise responses.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/ask_about_active_file.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nThis feature helps you understand file dependencies, methods, and structure. It also detects potential issues, suggests improvements, and more.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  The `Pieces: Ask About Active File` feature can also be applied during onboarding purposes to get helpful explanations for unfamiliar code.\n</Callout>\n\n## Adding Context to Copilot Chats\n\nYou can add context to a chat by adding `Files`**,** `Folders`**,** `Snippets`**,** `Websites`**,** and `Messages`**.**\n\nThis greatly boosts the number of generative AI responses you receive that will actually benefit you. It can provide **hyper-specific** responses because it’s contextually aware of your code.\n\nTo do this, select the **Starred Message Icon** in the bottom-left corner of your Copilot Chat window, which is openable from the JetBrains IDE sidebar.\n\nClick the **Starred Message Icon,** then add whatever context items you need.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/add_context_copilot.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nYou can also right-click a file from your project or active file tree and add that file as context to the conversation.\n\nThis can be done without opening the Pieces Copilot window. Right-click on a file in your open project and select `Add to Copilot Chat Context`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/add_to_copilot_context_file.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Adding Code Snippets\n\nYou can paste snippets of code as a code block inside of any Copilot Chat by clicking the `{ }` icon inside the chat window, then pasting in your code.\n\nThis is useful for bringing in code that isn’t present immediately in the active file as context, or for comparisons and suggestions.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/adding_code_to_chat.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Extracting Code from Screenshots\n\nYou can also extract code from screenshots directly from the Copilot chat menu by selecting `Extract Code from Screenshot`, selecting the desired screenshot from your **Finder** (macOS) or **File Explorer** (Windows/Linux) menu, and confirming.\n\nPieces Copilot will then scan the screenshot and generate the code captured from the image into the chat. You can copy, insert it at your cursor, save it as a snippet, and more.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/extract_from_screenshots.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## AI Quick Actions\n\nAbove the functions in your code, you can find the clickable `Pieces: Comment` and `Pieces: Explain` buttons.\n\nClick `Pieces: Explain` to open up the Pieces Copilot in the side window. The Pieces Copilot will automatically explain the purpose and function of that code within the chat.\n\nSimilarly, you can click `Pieces: Comment` above a function to have your preferred LLM generate documentation for that piece of code—you can then insert that code directly at the cursor by clicking `Insert at Cursor` or save it as a snippet using the built-in `Save to Pieces` button.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/pieces_explain_quick_action.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Improving Code Consistency & Standardization\n\nThe Pieces Copilot Chat is designed to assist you with various coding tasks to boost productivity and enhance your workflow. This is done primarily by eliminating **context-switching** (needing to leave your IDE to access generative AI).\n\n### Naming Inconsistencies\n\nSuppose functions across your workspace use inconsistent naming patterns (e.g., `authenticateUser` in `authHandler.go` vs. `retrieveUserProfile` in `userHandler.go`). In that case, Pieces Copilot can suggest adopting a standardized naming convention for better readability and maintainability, like this:\n\n```c\n// authHandler.go\nfunc authenticateUser(ctx context.Context, credentials Credentials) (User, error) {\n    if credentials.Username == \"\" || credentials.Password == \"\" {\n        return User{}, errors.New(\"missing credentials\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Inconsistent Error Handling\n\nIf error-handling strategies differ across files (e.g., structured errors in `authService.go` vs. inconsistent handling in `userService.go`), Pieces Copilot can help unify the approach:\n\n```c\n// authService.go\nfunc LoginUser(credentials Credentials) (string, error) {\n    token, err := authenticate(credentials)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"login failed: %w\", err)\n    }\n    return token, nil\n}\n```",

The recipient can view the snippet **without needing to have a Pieces account.**\n\n### via Right-Click Menu\n\nShareable Pieces links for your code snippets can also be generated by right-clicking a portion of selected code, hovering over the `Pieces` item in the pop-up menu, then selecting `Share via Pieces Link`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/sharing/share_via_pieces_link.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### via Keyboard Shortcut\n\nYou can share code snippets using the `⌘+L` (macOS) or `ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux). This is simply a shortcut to accessing the `Share via Pieces Link` tool in the right-click menu.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1731514636367/cbe143a0-d518-4073-9d24-5047a88daf45.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Generating Links for Existing Saved Snippets\n\nIf you saved a material but didn't create a shareable link at the time, don't worry. You can still generate, copy, regenerate, or delete the existing link from the Pieces Drive.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the Pieces Drive\">\n    Open the Pieces Drive via the Pieces Drive icon in the JetBrains sidebar.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Share the Snippet\">\n    After locating the snippet you’d like to share, right-click it and select `Generate Shareable Link` from the available actions.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/sharing/generate_shareable_link_drive.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Wait for the Link and Copy\">\n    After generating the link, a new modal will appear. Wait for the snippet to be shared with an automatically generated link, or manually copy the link from the modal.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nIf you have generated a link for that snippet previously, the `More Actions` menu options will automatically adjust to include three new actions:\n\n* `Open in Browser`: Opens the existing shareable link in your desired browser.\n\n* `Refresh Link`: Regenerates the link—this is important if a snippet has been edited or updated, as a new link will be required to contain the latest changes.\n\n* `Revoke Link`: Revokes the shareable link so that anyone with the existing link to that snippet will be barred from future access.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/sharing/share_link_options.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Enriched Sharing Experience\n\nWhen you `Share` a snippet, it’s not just the code included. The snippet has additional metadata to provide context—<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"#what-information-gets-shared\">you can read more about that here.</a>\n\n* `Snippet Type`: Identify the language or framework, such as Python or React.\n\n* `Tags`: Useful keywords for quick categorization.\n\n* `Description`: A short summary of what the snippet does.\n\n* `Related Links`: Helpful resources or documentation tied to the snippet.\n\n* `Author Information`: A record of who created the snippet.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1731514684555/707b0769-5b68-448c-811b-a44d2414a10d.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## What Information Gets Shared\n\nWhen a snippet is saved to the Pieces Cloud, the code is enriched with [valuable information](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet) such as related people, links, annotations, tags, and an automatically-generated description.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1731623145740/ec60e89f-ac2f-4396-b6a8-ad94f57d9745.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp&q=75\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"false\" />\n\n### Sensitive Information Watchdog\n\nThe `Share via Pieces Link` feature does more than allow you to effectively share snippets across your entire team and other communities, though.\n\nYou'll see a section titled **Sensitive Information:**\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1731514684555/707b0769-5b68-448c-811b-a44d2414a10d.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nOur in-house ML model scans snippets for potentially sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, and alerts you so that you can make an informed decision before sharing the snippet.  \n\nThe scan happens locally using on-device machine learning models **before the snippet is uploaded to the cloud** for sharing. This allows you to make an informed decision about sharing your code.",

kinds of code snippets and easily find [them](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) whenever, wherever, and however you need.\n\nLet’s take a look at some examples:\n\n***\n\n| `SQL Query Templates`        | An SQL query to retrieve data from a database with filter conditions.                         | Save time with databases by

href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces\">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a> connects you with your development environment, allowing you to focus on what matters—building great software—while empowering you with tools for efficient code reuse.\n\n* **Improved Productivity:** Focus on solving new problems rather than resolving old ones.\n\n* **Contextual Awareness:** Snippets enriched with metadata, descriptions, and links to relevant searches help you remember each piece of code's origin, purpose, and ideal usage scenarios.\n\n* **Code Standardization:** Sharing best practices and reusable components helps developers ensure uniform coding practices and conventions are available across different teams and projects.\n\nBy using the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces\">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a>, you can capture and manage these snippets to streamline daily tasks and enhance your workflow in several ways:\n\n### Save & Organize\n\nUsers can save snippets by highlighting the desired code, right-clicking, and selecting the `Save to Pieces` option.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/MAIN_using_snippets/save_to_pieces.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nYou can also do this without opening the right-click menu—use the `⌥+⌘+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux) shortcut while your code is highlighted.\n\nThis guarantees that essential pieces of code, such as code fragments, functions, configuration files, and command-line instructions, are always at hand when needed.\n\nAdditionally, [each snippet is enriched with context](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/save-snippets#what-happens-when-you-save-a-snippet), enabling you to insert well-documented, relevant snippets where they make sense within your projects.\n\n<Image

align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nPieces can also intelligently identify and save snippets based on re-use patterns in your JetBrains workflow.\n\nWhenever Pieces saves a snippet, you'll see a confirmation in the bottom right corner of your screen that says `Snippet Successfully Saved to Pieces`.\n\nYour snippet is now saved in Pieces Drive with auto-generated metadata!\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/MAIN_using_snippets/opening_snippet.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Search & Reuse\n\nYou can [search your entire collection of saved Pieces code snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/search-reuse) inside of your preferred JetBrains IDE, so the code you need is always on hand.\n\nTo do this, open the **Search Everywhere** window and switch to the `Pieces` tab by using `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux).\n\nEnter a search query, and any related snippets will appear in the dropdown list—then you can hit enter and view your snippet (with all of its saved context) rendered in markdown directly inside your editor.\n\n<Image

alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Edit & Update\n\nYou can easily [edit and update code snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) directly from your IDE without opening a separate window or navigating to the Pieces for Developers Desktop App.\n\nTo do so, open the **Pieces** from the tool window on the left-hand side of your JetBrains IDE, revealing a list of saved snippets. You can then right-click a snippet, which opens that snippet up in a new window.\n\nMake changes and save the snippet using `⌘+s` (macOS) or `ctrl+s` (Windows/Linux).\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/MAIN_using_snippets/editing_snippet.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Sharing\n\nThe **Sharing Snippets** feature allows you to [share code snippets with your team](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/sharing) or across projects directly from your JetBrains IDE.\n\nTo share a snippet, right-click on some highlighted code, hover over the Pieces option, and select `Share via Pieces Link`.\n\nYou can also share a snippet by right-clicking a snippet that’s listed in the left-hand toolbar window in any of your JetBrains IDEs and clicking `Share via Pieces Link`**.**\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/MAIN_using_snippets/share_via_pieces_link.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWith Pieces for JetBrains Plugin, your snippets become a robust library of reusable code that you can organize, search, edit, and share across projects.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use them:\n\n### Reusable Scheduling Functions\n\nImagine you’re frequently working on projects that involve scheduling tasks at regular intervals.\n\nInstead of rewriting the same logic for each new project, you can [save an evergreen snippet to your Pieces repository.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets)\n\nThis allows you to reuse a well-crafted scheduling function across multiple applications, that is useful in a variety of scenarios:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\n// A reusable function to schedule tasks at a specified interval\nfunc scheduleTask(interval time.Duration, task func()) {\n\tticker := time.NewTicker(interval)\n\tdefer ticker.Stop()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase <-ticker.C:\n\t\t\ttask()\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### File System Monitoring\n\nSuppose you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes. In that case, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets) that does precisely that, using generic and reusable naming conventions:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n\n// A reusable function to monitor file system changes\nfunc watchFileChanges(path string) {\n\twatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer watcher.Close()\n\n\terr = watcher.Add(path)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase event := <-watcher.Events:\n\t\t\tif event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Modified file:\", event.Name)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tcase err := <-watcher.Errors:\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Snippet Scenarios\n\nReview some additional scenarios and use cases for Pieces Snippets and see how the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces\">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a> could benefit you and your workflow.\n\n***\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Project Initialization\">\n    Quickly set up new projects by reusing boilerplate code.\n\n    Save standard project initialization scripts, configuration files, and setup commands as snippets to ensure consistency and save time when starting a new project.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Common Functions and Utilities\">\n    Reuse frequently used functions and utility methods by saving snippets of commonly used functions, such as data validation methods, API request handlers, or utility functions.\n\n    This allows you to quickly insert these snippets into new projects without rewriting them.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Configuration Management\">\n    Save snippets of configuration files for development, testing, and production to manage and reuse configuration files across different environments.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Documentation and Learning\">\n    Create a library of well-documented code examples for learning and reference by saving snippets with detailed descriptions and metadata.\n\n    This personal or team library of code examples makes learning new concepts easier and referencing how specific tasks were previously accomplished.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Command-Line Instructions\">\n    Store complicated command-line instructions as a code snippet so that you don’t need to remember the syntax every time you need to use a specific command-line instruction.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Bug Fixes and Patches\">\n    Save and reuse bug fixes or patches by storing the fix as a snippet when you solve a common bug or issue.\n\n    This allows you to quickly apply the same fix in other projects or share it with team members who might encounter the same issue.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n***\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/get-started\">Download the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin today!</a>",

This version offers better compatibility until a permanent fix is released for Hedgehog.\n\nTo downgrade Android Studio, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Uninstall Hedgehog (2023.1.1)** from your device.\n\n2. **Download Giraffe (2022.3.1 Patch 4)** from the Android Studio archives, which you can find here.\n\n3. **Reinstall Android Studio** using the Giraffe version and switch the runtime to JCEF-enabled using the instructions above.\n\n## Unable to Find the JetBrains Plugin in the JetBrains Marketplace[​](https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/jetbrains#i-cant-find-the-pieces-jetbrains-plugin-in-the-jetbrains-marketplace)\n\nIf you can't find the Pieces for Developers JetBrains Plugin in the JetBrains Marketplace, you can navigate directly to it using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets\">this link</a>.\n\n## Updating[​](https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/jetbrains#updating)\n\nThe Pieces for JetBrains Plugin will automatically update when a new version is available.\n\nYou can manually update the plugin by going to your Plugins window using `⌘+shift+x` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+x` (Windows/Linux).\n\nNext, locate the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin (titled ‘Pieces’) and click the **update button.**\n\n### Check PiecesOS Status\n\nCheck to make sure PiecesOS is running. PiecesOS must be running for the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin to work.\n\n### Restart JetBrains After Updates\n\nIf you’ve recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin, restart the IDE.\n\n## Reloading the Pieces Copilot Chat Window\n\nYou may need to restart or refresh the Pieces Copilot chat, especially if you’re using a cloud LLM and disconnect from WiFi.\n\nThese scenarios can occasionally cause the LLM to ‘hang’—to appear as if generating a response but eventually timing out, entering an infinite response loop, or experiencing other issues.\n\nTo do so, click the small `Reload Copilot` symbol above the Pieces Copilot chat once it is open.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/troubleshooting/reload_copilot.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />",

Copilot\n\nPieces Copilot offers [AI-assisted features](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot) like starting contextualized [generative AI conversations](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot/chat), <a target=\"_blank\"

snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive) to boost your workflow productivity and streamline collaboration with others.\n\nThese features let developers store their favorite code in a personal, easy-to-access library. They can quickly review past work, find related authors and links with the extra details saved with each piece, and more.\n\n<Image

the editor with your LLM of choice about a specific code snippet, fragment, folder, or terminal output.\n\nThe **Ask Copilot** feature is the backbone of the Pieces Copilot experience.\n\nPieces for Developers recently rolled out its new **AI Quick Actions** feature—similar to VS Code’s Codelens—which allows for select quick actions powered by Pieces Copilot, namely `Pieces: Explain` and `Pieces: Comment`.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  The Quick Action tools—`Pieces: Explain` and `Pieces: Comment`—are above the function nearest to your cursor.\n</Callout>\n\nUsing either AI Quick Actions triggers the Pieces Copilot conversation window, where you can find the output from the LLM of your choice.\n\nThese AI Quick Action tools live above certain pieces of code, like functions, so you always have easy access to them.\n\n<Image

Additionally, confirm that you have the latest version of PiecesOS, requiring at least version **11.3.6**.\n\n## Check PiecesOS Status\n\nEnsure that PiecesOS is running. It must be active for the Pieces for Jupyter Extension to function correctly.\n\n## Restart Jupyter Lab After Updates\n\nIf you’ve recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for Jupyter Extension, restart Jupyter Lab to apply the updates properly.\n\nIf the issues persist, contact the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-obsidian\">Pieces Support Team</a>.\n\n## Refreshing Copilot Chats\n\nIf you're using the Pieces Copilot chat and lose your WiFi connection or face problems with a cloud-based LLM, refreshing the chat might be necessary. This action can fix issues like the LLM seemingly \"hanging\" (for instance, producing a response that times out or gets stuck in an infinite loop).\n\nTo refresh the chat, click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of your Copilot Chat window and select `Refresh`.\n\n> screenshot of hovering over the refresh option within the chat",

You do not need to use **Save As,** as the file is already existing and this is simply updating the settings file, which comes with the Pieces for Sublime Text package.\n</Callout>",

Its main benefit is helping developers navigate their codebase by using the Pieces context-awareness engine to provide accurate information, even for specific prompts.\n\n## Adding Context to Copilot Chats\n\nThere are a number of individual items you can add as context to a chat, namely **Files, Folders,** and **Snippets**.\n\nThis flexibility is useful when reference materials aren't directly accessible from Sublime Text or when you want to **compartmentalize context** by keeping files or folders from other projects separate from your active workflow.\n\nTo do this:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Select the Message Icon\">\n    You can select the **Message Icon** on the left side of any of your chats in the Copilot Chat window.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Select your Context Type\">\n    A new menu will appear. Choose the type of context you want to add, then select the item you wish to include in the Copilot chat.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/sublime_text_plugin_assets/pieces_ai_copilot/chat/adding_context_to_copilot_chats.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Improving Code Consistency & Standardization\n\nThe Pieces Copilot helps improve code quality by identifying inconsistencies and providing actionable suggestions for standardization.\n\n### Naming Inconsistencies\n\nIf functions across your workspace use inconsistent naming patterns (e.g., `authenticateUser` in `authHandler.go` vs. `retrieveUserProfile` in `userHandler.go`), Pieces Copilot can suggest adopting a standardized naming convention for better readability and maintainability, like this:\n\n```c\n// authHandler.go\nfunc authenticateUser(ctx context.Context, credentials Credentials) (User, error) {\n    if credentials.Username == \"\" || credentials.Password == \"\" {\n        return User{}, errors.New(\"missing credentials\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Inconsistent Error Handling\n\nIf error-handling strategies differ across files (e.g., structured errors in `authService.go` vs. inconsistent handling in `userService.go`), Pieces Copilot can help unify the approach:\n\n```c\n// authService.go\nfunc LoginUser(credentials Credentials) (string, error) {\n    token, err := authenticate(credentials)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"login failed: %w\", err)\n    }\n    return token, nil\n}\n```",

Here are some everyday tasks where it can help:\n\n* **Renaming Variables or Functions Across Multiple Files:** Instead of manually searching for occurrences, just instruct Pieces Copilot to rename them. It updates references automatically, reducing the chance of a missed or broken link.\n\n* **Updating a Deprecated API Call:** Legacy code often uses outdated methods. Instruct Pieces Copilot to replace the old API call with the new one and handle any necessary parameter or return-value changes.\n\n* **Adding Error Handling to a Function:** If you have a function without proper error handling, ask Pieces Copilot to wrap it in a try/catch block, or add more robust error-logging statements.\n\n* **Reorganizing Code for Better Readability:** Large functions with multiple responsibilities can be split into smaller helper functions, or code blocks can be reordered for clarity. Pieces Copilot can assist by identifying logical sections and extracting them into new functions.\n\n* **Converting Code Syntax:** Use “Modify” to transform class components into functional components (in React), convert promise chains into async/await, or update ES5 syntax to ES6+.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Try using the `Modify` function to implement error handling, update deprecated methods, add logging to several functions, or refactor variable names for consistency.\n</Callout>",

You can `right-click` the snippet, hover over `Pieces`, go to `Quick Actions`, and select `Fix a bug`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/sublime_text_plugin_assets/getting_started/fixing_bug_onboarding.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"false\" />\n\n### Pieces Copilot\n\nThis is when you're introduced to opening Pieces Copilot. When you select `Copilot`, Pieces will open a new tab with Pieces Copilot ready for a prompt!\n\nOnce you open the Copilot, the onboarding step is done. You can now ask [questions about your code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot/chat), [document it](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot/documenting-code), [debug errors](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot/debugging-errors), or [refactor selected material](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot/refactoring)—all within the Sublime Text interface.\n\n### Explain\n\nYou might encounter some sections of code, whether from GitHub or something you haven't looked at in a while. Pieces provides an explanation feature to help you understand what's going on in the code—this section shows you how to use it.\n\nWhen you click `explanation`, a new tab will open. Right-click, hover over `Pieces`, go to `Ask Copilot`, and select `Explain`.\n\n### Explore the Features\n\nThe final three steps provide useful information to help you use PiecesOS without any problems. Select `documentation` to access this guide and learn more about Pieces for Sublime Text.\n\nIf you encounter more issues than expected, select `Pieces: Get Support` to access our support right away.\n\nIf you have more questions or want to join the Pieces community, select `Pieces: About` in step 10, which will open a tab with all our community and support links.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/sublime_text_plugin_assets/getting_started/pieces_about.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"false\" />\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nTo uninstall the Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin, open your Command window in Sublime Text by using `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux), locating the `Package Control: Remove Package`, looking for the option `Pieces` and clicking the option.\n\nIn order for Pieces to be completely uninstalled from the Sublime Text, you'll need to restart the IDE.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/sublime_text_plugin_assets/getting_started/uninstalling_pieces_sublime_plugin.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Restart your Sublime Text editor after uninstalling the plugin to complete to uninstallation process.\n</Callout>",

PiecesOS must be running for the Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin to work.\n\n### Restart Sublime Text After Updates\n\nIf you’ve recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin, restart the IDE.\n\nContact the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-sublime\">Pieces support team</a> if the issue still persists.\n\n### macOS-Specific Configuration\n\nMake sure that the `host` object inside the Pieces Settings file is **empty,** not set to `localhost:1000` as this creates issues with Package Control trying to load the Pieces Package, and can disable the plugin.\n\n### Reload the Plugin<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/sublime#reload-the-plugin\">​</a>\n\nIf you're experiencing an issue or something isn't working properly, try reloading the plugin.\n\nTo do so, open the command palette using `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows / Linux) and typing `Pieces: Reload Plugin`, then press Enter.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/sublime_text_plugin_assets/troubleshooting/reload_plugin_sublime.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />",

It allows users to manage saved code snippets and access [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot) features.\n\n* [Pieces Copilot:](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot) Engage in AI-driven conversations to enhance productivity by generating code, adding comments, troubleshooting, and more—all contextualized to your project by adding files and folders as context.\n\n* [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/drive): Effortlessly save, locate, and share frequently used code snippets to the Pieces Drive—making it easier to organize your work, quickly access important pieces of code, and collaborate effectively with others.\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Getting Started\" image=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743515885562/36f40b96-ec11-4a3b-8542-4ce11bc6ff4a.webp\">\n    [Follow these instructions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/get-started) to download and install the Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Troubleshooting\" image=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743515892062/d99ff323-61f6-40b8-b761-08accc1484f2.webp\">\n    Explore [troubleshooting options,](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/troubleshooting) navigate to our [support page,](https://docs.pieces.app/products/support) or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ22WJ2Htd2wRMJhueCNYc0xbFBFCAN-khijcuoXACd_Uux3wIhgZeGkzDRcqD3teamAI-CwCHpr\">directly book a call</a> with our engineers.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\nThe Pieces for Sublime Text plugin offers developers **two main pillars of functionality**:\n\n1. **Pieces Copilot**: Offers [AI-assisted features](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot) like contextualized generative AI conversations, adding code comments, and troubleshooting code\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/sublime_text_plugin_assets/sublime_text/about_current_selection.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n2. **Pieces Drive**: Enables you to [save, edit, search, and share useful code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/drive) snippets to boost your workflow productivity and streamline collaboration with others\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/sublime_text_plugin_assets/sublime_text/save_to_pieces.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Using the Pieces Copilot\n\nInside your Sublime Text Editor, Pieces Copilot enables you to perform **various actions**, such as initiating a conversation directly within the editor using your preferred LLM about a specific code snippet, fragment, or folder.\n\nTo start, you can [initiate a conversation with the LLM of your choice](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot/chat), providing as much context as needed by adding files, folders, or even entire repositories to the conversation.\n\nTo explore available options, simply select a portion of your code, right-click, and hover over the `Pieces` item in the context menu. From here, you’ll find several quick actions, including:\n\n* `Explain`: Get detailed explanations of the code’s functionality.\n\n* `Quick Actions`: Gives 3 options to fix a bug in your code, modify the selected code, or add comments to the selection.\n\n- `Ask Copilot`: Gives you 2 options to ask the copilot about the selected code or to explain the selected code to you.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/sublime_text_plugin_assets/sublime_text/chatting_with_selection.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Using Pieces Drive\n\nUsers can save snippets by right-clicking the selected code and choosing the `Save to Pieces` option, edit saved materials with a simple command, and share snippets via generated shareable links.\n\nCommonly saved snippets include **utility functions, database queries, and API request templates**—these are frequently reused, so saving them streamlines development and keeps reusable code easily accessible.\n\nCommon materials types include utility functions, API requests, and reusable code blocks.\n\nWhen a snippet is saved, the plugin also automatically generates and associates meta data, like **tags, commit messages, code types, smart descriptions,** as well as **code authors and related resources.**\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733962137844/78f6c994-d7c7-4a50-b63d-88c83e7c8a2a.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Referencing & Reusing\n\nThere are 3 ways to [search through your saved snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/drive/search-reuse) in the Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin:\n\n* `Fuzzy Search`: Quickly find snippets even if your search term doesn’t match the saved text exactly. This is useful for locating snippets with slight variations in names or typos.\n\n* `Full-Text Search`: Searches through the entire content of your saved snippets. Ideal for when you remember part of the snippet but not the exact title or tags.\n\n* `Neural Code Search`: Uses AI to understand the context of your query, making it possible to find snippets even when your search term is related *conceptually* rather than *textually*. This is useful for complex searches where exact matches aren’t obvious.\n\nThese options allow you to search with vague queries or get specific when you know exactly what you’re looking for, so you can find and reuse your snippets.\n\nOnce you’ve located a snippet using one of the search methods, you can then refactor the code to your needs, share the code with other developers, or paste it directly into your code.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733962194701/f9aff393-efd8-43be-addf-b3ac37c118c8.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n***\n\n## Download the Plugin\n\nReady to streamline your development?

    "content": "***\n\n## Accessing Copilot Chat in Visual Studio\n\nThere are four primary ways to access generative AI conversations with the Pieces Copilot.\n\nIf the Pieces Copilot window isn't open, you can open it using the methods below, or by opening the command palette with `ctrl+shift+p`, searching for `Pieces Copilot`, and selecting it or pressing enter, or by using the keybind `alt+m,c`.\n\n### via Right-Click Menu\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Highlight Code and Right-Click\">\n    Highlight any code segment and right-click to open the tool menu.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Choose &#x22;Ask Copilot&#x22;\">\n    Choose an option from the list that best fits your use case:\n\n    * `Ask Copilot About Selection`\n\n    * `Ask Copilot About Active File`\n\n    * `Add Active File to Copilot Context`\n\n    * `Explain Selection with Copilot`\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Enter Question\">\n    A new menu will appear, prompting you to enter your question. Type your query and press `Enter`.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/ask_about_file.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### via Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nYou can also open up a dialogue with the Pieces Copilot chat—specifically the `Ask Copilot` option—by using the shortcut `alt+m` and then pressing `a`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/asking_question_input_modal_for_asking_about_selection.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### via Command Palette\n\nOpen the command palette with `ctrl+shift+p`, and enter commands, such as:\n\n`Pieces > Ask Copilot about Selection`: Generates suggestions or improvements for the selected code snippet.\n\n`Pieces > Ask Copilot About Active File`: Provides insights for the current file open in your Visual Studio editor.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/command_pallette.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nRead more about [what commands are available in the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/commands).\n\n### via AI Quick Actions\n\nOne quick way to get an explanation for a confusing or unclear function is by using the new [AI Quick Actions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio#using-ai-quick-actions) feature in the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension.\n\nClick the `Pieces` tool above a code function, then select `Explain`. This will start a conversation about the selected function.\n\nYou can also right-click a selected portion of code, hover over `Pieces`, and select `Explain Selection with Copilot`.\n\nThis action triggers the Copilot Chat window, which provides a detailed explanation and summary of the code's logic.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/pieces_explain_quick_action.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nThere is also `Pieces > Comment`, which you can read more about [here](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/documenting-code).\n\n## Contextualized Chats\n\nYou can use two levels of contextual awareness in Visual Studio to start a conversation or add code to an existing Copilot Chat with the Pieces Copilot.\n\n### Pieces > Ask Copilot About Selection\n\nUse the `Pieces > Ask Copilot About Selection` button to interact with Copilot about specific code snippets, functions, or classes.\n\nTo use this feature:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Select a Portion/Piece of Code\">\n    Select a portion of code or select a class in the solution explorer.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Right-Click\">\n    Open the tool menu by right-clicking your selection.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Locate “Ask Copilot About Selection”\">\n    Locate the `Pieces` tool menu section, hover over it, and select `Ask Copilot About Selection`.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Ask your Question\">\n    Type your prompt in the text input field and press `enter`.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThis approach is perfect for **quick insights** or **guidance** on specific code functionality.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/asking_question_input_modal_for_asking_about_selection.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Pieces > Ask Copilot About Active File\n\nThe `Pieces > Ask About Active File` feature targets the current file, providing specific insights and help with debugging.\n\nThere are two ways to access this command:\n\n1. Right-click inside your file, hover over `Pieces`, and select the `Ask Copilot about Active File`. Then enter your query into the drop-down text input field.\n\n2. Open the command palette using `ctrl+shift+p` and enter `Pieces > Ask Copilot About Active File`. Then enter your query into the drop-down text input field.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  You can also use the default keybind to ask Pieces Copilot about the active file by pressing `alt+m,a`\n</Callout>\n\nAfter you enter your question, Pieces Copilot will analyze the file's context to provide precise responses that you can accept and insert at the cursor, directly placing them into your code environment.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/ask_about_file.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nThis feature helps you understand file dependencies, methods, and structure. It also detects potential issues, suggests improvements, and more.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  The `Pieces > Ask About Active File` feature can also be applied during onboarding purposes to get helpful explanations for unfamiliar code.\n</Callout>\n\n## Adding Context to Copilot Chats\n\nYou can add context to a chat by adding `Files`**,** `Folders`**,** `Snippets`**,** `Websites`**,** and `Messages`**.**\n\nThis flexibility is especially useful when reference materials are not directly accessible from Visual Studio or when you want to compartmentalize context, minimizing overlap by keeping files or folders from other projects separate from your active workflow.\n\nTo do this, you can select the **Starred Message Icon** in the bottom-left corner of your Copilot Chat window, which you can open from the Visual Studio sidebar.\\`\n\nClick the **Starred Message Icon**, then add whatever context items you need.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/adding_context.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Adding Code Snippets\n\nYou can insert code snippets as a code block in any Copilot Chat by clicking the `{ }` icon in the chat window and pasting your code.\n\nThis feature is particularly helpful for referencing code that isn't in the active file, making comparisons, and receiving tailored suggestions.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/snippet_in_chat.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Extracting Code from Screenshots\n\nYou can extract code directly from screenshots through the Copilot Chat menu. Select `Extract Code from Screenshot`, choose the desired screenshot from your File Explorer, and confirm.\n\nPieces Copilot will scan the screenshot, generate the code from the image, and display it in the chat.

In that case, can suggest adopting a standardized naming convention for better readability and maintainability, like this:\n\n```go\n// authHandler.go\nfunc authenticateUser(ctx context.Context, credentials Credentials) (User, error) {\n    if credentials.Username == \"\" || credentials.Password == \"\" {\n        return User{}, errors.New(\"missing credentials\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Inconsistent Error Handling\n\nIf error-handling strategies vary across files (e.g., structured errors in `authService.go` vs. inconsistent handling in `userService.go`), Pieces Copilot can standardize the approach. For example:\n\n```go\n// authService.go\nfunc LoginUser(credentials Credentials) (string, error) {\n    token, err := authenticate(credentials)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"login failed: %w\", err)\n    }\n    return token, nil\n}\n```",

This enhances readability and makes your code easier to understand.\n\n### via Pieces > Comment\n\nA quick way to add documentation to a function is by using the [AI Quick Actions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio#using-ai-quick-actions) feature, visible above actionable tasks in your code. This feature allows you to generate comments to explain the logic and purpose of your functions directly within your editor.\n\nTo get started:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Locate the Pieces Quick Actions\">\n    Look for the `Pieces` button above individual functions in your code.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Open the Pieces Menu\">\n    Click the Pieces `Quick Action` button to open the available options.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Select the Comment Option\">\n    Choose `Comment` from the menu to let the Copilot generate meaningful documentation for the function.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Accept Changes\">\n    Review the generated comments and click `Accept Changes` to insert them into your code.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/documenting_code/adding_comments_quick_action.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nYou can also right-click a selected portion of code, hover over `Pieces`, and choose `Comment Selection with Copilot`.

They **provide context for reviewers**, allowing them to focus on functionality and **understand complex reasoning**, making the code easier to follow and maintain.\n\nGood documentation improves code readability and accelerates onboarding for people unfamiliar with the codebase. This dual benefit supports **current and** **future development** by creating a strong **foundation for upgrades and iterations**.\n\nComments also serve as a memory aid, helping you remember the purpose and function of the code when revisiting it after a long time away.\n\nThat’s what makes the Pieces Copilot’s commenting feature so powerful. Whether you’re documenting a single function or hundreds of lines of code, simply highlight the desired code, click the `Pieces` CodeLens button, select **Comment**, and let Copilot take care of the rest.",

The recipient can view the snippet **without needing to have a Pieces account.**\n\n### via Right-Click Menu\n\nShareable Pieces links for your code snippets can be generated by right-clicking a portion of selected code, hovering over the `Pieces` item in the pop-up menu, then clicking `Share Current Selection`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/using_snippets/sharing/share_current_selection.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### via Keyboard Shortcut\n\nYou can generate shareable links for your code snippets using the `alt+M, L` keyboard shortcut after highlighting the desired code within your active file.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/using_snippets/sharing/generating_share_link_keybind.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Generating Links for Existing Saved Snippets\n\nIf you save a material, but didn’t generate a shareable link at the time, no problem. You can still generate a shareable link (or copy, regenerate, or delete the existing link) from the **Quick Menu** within the Pieces Drive view.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the Pieces Drive View\">\n    Open the Pieces Drive view and find the saved material for which you want to generate a shareable link.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Launch the Quick Menu\">\n    Once you’ve located the saved material you want to share, click the **three vertical dots** to open the **Quick Menu.**\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Generate the Shareable Link\">\n    After the quick menu opens, you’ll see a section titled **Shareable Link**. Click `Generate Shareable Link` to generate it and automatically copy it to your clipboard.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/using_snippets/sharing/share_current_snippet_quick_menu.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n    You can also generate the link using the right-click menu if you edit the saved material. This opens the code in an independent file. To do this, right-click the selected piece, hover over `Pieces`, and click `Share Current Selection`.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Share the Saved Material\">\n    Your shareable link has now been copied to your clipboard, so you can share it with anyone—no need for them to have a Pieces Account.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Enriched Sharing Experience\n\nWhen you `Share` a snippet, it’s not just the code included. The snippet has additional metadata to provide context—[you can read more about that here.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet)\n\n* `Snippet Type`: Identify the language or framework, such as Python or React.\n\n* `Tags`: Useful keywords for quick categorization.\n\n* `Description`: A short summary of what the snippet does.\n\n* `Related Links`: Helpful resources or documentation tied to the snippet.\n\n* `Author Information`: A record of who created the snippet.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1731514684555/707b0769-5b68-448c-811b-a44d2414a10d.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## What Information Gets Shared\n\nWhen a snippet is saved to the Pieces Drive, the code is [enriched with valuable information](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet) such as related people, links, annotations, tags, and an automatically-generated description.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/using_snippets/using_snippets_MAIN/shared_snippet_in_browser.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Sensitive Information Watchdog\n\nThe `Share` feature does more than allow you to effectively share snippets across your entire team and other communities, though.\n\nYou'll see a section titled **Sensitive Information:**\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732743695009/a44bf8b1-67b7-4db0-a6af-87798c8df9ed.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nOur in-house ML model scans snippets for potentially sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, and alerts you so that you can make an informed decision before sharing the snippet.  \n\nThe scan happens locally using on-device machine learning models **before the snippet is uploaded to the cloud** for sharing. This allows you to make an informed decision about sharing your code.",

This will send your code to the cloud, generate a link, and copy it to your clipboard.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/using_snippets/using_snippets_MAIN/shared_snippet_in_browser.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  You can send anyone a shareable link containing your code snippet, even if they don’t use Pieces or have a Pieces for Developers account.\n</Callout>\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWith the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension, your snippets transform into a robust library of reusable code. You can organize, search, edit, and share these snippets across various projects.\n\nHere are some ways you might use them:\n\n### Reusable Scheduling Functions\n\nSuppose you often work on projects that require scheduling tasks at regular intervals.\n\nInstead of writing the same code for each new project, you can write a reusable function, then save it to your Pieces Drive.\n\nThis enables you to apply a well-designed scheduling function across different applications, such as this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\n// A reusable function to schedule tasks at a specified interval\nfunc scheduleTask(interval time.Duration, task func()) {\n\tticker := time.NewTicker(interval)\n\tdefer ticker.Stop()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase <-ticker.C:\n\t\t\ttask()\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### File System Monitoring\n\nSuppose you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes. In that case, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets) that does precisely that, using generic and reusable naming conventions:\n\n```python\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\nimport time\n\nclass FileMonitorHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n    def on_modified(self, event):\n        print(f\"File modified: {event.src_path}\")\n\n    def on_created(self, event):\n        print(f\"File created: {event.src_path}\")\n\n    def on_deleted(self, event):\n        print(f\"File deleted: {event.src_path}\")\n\ndef monitor_directory(directory=\".\"):\n    observer = Observer()\n    event_handler = FileMonitorHandler()\n    observer.schedule(event_handler, directory, recursive=True)\n    observer.start()\n    try:\n        while True:\n            time.sleep(1)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        observer.stop()\n    observer.join()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    monitor_directory()  # Monitors the current directory\n```\n\n## **Additional Snippet Scenarios**\n\nReview some additional scenarios and use cases for Pieces Snippets and see how the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.PiecesVisualStudio\">Pieces for Visual Studio Extension</a> could benefit you and your workflow.\n\n***\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Testing Framework Templates\">\n    Streamline testing by saving snippets for your frequently used testing functions or unit test templates.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Command-Line Utilities\">\n    Save command-line instructions as snippets to quickly retrieve deployment commands, Docker setups, and other essential terminal operations.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Quickly Create New Projects\">\n    Import saved setup scripts, configuration files, and commonly used dependencies to speed up project setup and ensure consistency across new projects.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Error Handling & Logging\">\n    You can also save standard logging functions or error-handling snippets that can be reused across applications, promoting consistent error management.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n***\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.PiecesVisualStudio\">Download the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension today!</a>",

[Learn more about PiecesOS.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os)\n\n* **Visual Studio:** Visual Studio is installed on your development machine.\n\n* **Windows:** Visual Studio is no longer available on macOS and is exclusively designed and maintained for Windows devices.\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  PiecesOS must be installed to enable the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension. For enhanced functionality, we also recommend the Pieces for Developers Desktop App.\n</Callout>\n\n## Installation\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Extensions\">\n    Open Visual Studio and navigate to the **Extensions** view in your toolbar.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Search for the Pieces Extension\">\n    Search for **Pieces for Visual Studio** and click `Install`.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/get_started/hovering_install.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Restart\">\n    Restart Visual Studio after installing the extension to complete the setup.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Use the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension\">\n    Once you’ve restarted Visual Studio, the **Pieces Account, Pieces Copilot,** and **Pieces Drive** views will automatically open as docked tabs in your `Solution Explorer` view.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nAlternatively, you can download the .VSIX installer from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.PiecesVisualStudio\">Visual Studio Marketplace</a> and install it manually.\n\n### Setting Up PiecesOS\n\nPiecesOS is a background service that runs on your computer. It handles local data processing and manages custom machine learning (ML) models used in Pieces software.\n\nTo use the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode\">Pieces for Visual Studio Extension</a>, you must install <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os\">PiecesOS</a> on your operating system.\n\nClick below to download PiecesOS for Windows.\n\n<get-started-windows />\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  For enhanced security and better system integration, we recommend installing the `.exe` version, as more security protocols recognize and accept `.exe` files more than `.appinstaller` packages.\n</Callout>\n\n## Updating\n\nThe Pieces for Visual Studio Extension will automatically update when a new version is available.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  The `Auto Update` setting is enabled by default.\n</Callout>\n\n## Pieces Cloud / Pieces Account\n\nConnecting to the Pieces Cloud is optional. However, it **provides additional features** like **data backups,** [**shareable links**](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/drive/sharing)**, and more.** You can enjoy the main functionalities of Pieces without an account.\n\nYou can log into your account and connect to the Pieces Cloud from the **Pieces Account** view, a tab which can be found next to the `Solution Explorer` view in your IDE’s sidebar.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/get_started/pieces_account_view.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nFrom here, you can click `Sign In / Sign Out` under the **Account** section, or `Connect / Disconnect` under the **Cloud** section.\n\nConnecting your Pieces account and personal cloud allows you to access features like data backups and shareable links, but it is not required.\n\n## Onboarding\n\nThe Pieces for Visual Studio extension has an interactive walkthrough that shows all of the steps in one panel. This onboarding page guides you on saving, viewing, and using saved materials, as well as how to get the most out of the Pieces for Visual Studio extension.\n\n### Save Your First Material\n\nClick `Save your first material`, and Pieces will open the [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/drive) to save a sample snippet, showing you how it works.\n\nYou'll see the snippet immediately in the **Saved Materials** list. This demonstrates how Pieces captures items and keeps them organized for easy reuse.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/get_started/saving_first_material.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### View Your Saved Materials\n\nClick `View Your Saved Materials`, and Pieces Drive will open to your **Saved Materials**, displaying any snippets you saved earlier along with the new snippet generated above.\n\n### Check Out the Pieces Copilot\n\nClick `Open Your Pieces Copilot` to open the Pieces Copilot side panel. In the Pieces Copilot, you'll find **suggested prompts**, options to set context from folders or files, and quick options to access your saved materials.\n\nOnce you open the Copilot, the onboarding process is complete. You're ready to [ask questions about your code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/chat), [document it](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/documenting-code), or [refactor a selected material](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/refactoring)—all within the Visual Studio interface.\n\n### Ask Copilot with Your New Material\n\nClick `Ask Copilot about Your Material`, and Pieces will add the new snippet to the Copilot chat with the sample prompt “What does this code do?”. Press `Enter` to send your snippet to the Copilot, and you'll get an explanation or suggestions about the snippet.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/get_started/opening_test_snippet.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Customize your Experience\n\nThis section allows you to `Open Pieces Settings` where you’re able to customize the way Pieces work in Visual Studio. [You can view the options here](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/configuration).\n\n### Supercharge Your Workflow\n\nClick `Pieces Documentation` to access our complete guide, which includes advanced tips, setup instructions, and best practices. Select `Reset Steps` to revisit any onboarding step at any time.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/get_started/supercharge_workflow.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  You can also opt into never showing the steps again by clicking `Do not show this again`.\n</Callout>\n\n## Uninstallation\n\nTo uninstall the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension, follow these steps:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Extensions\">\n    Open Visual Studio and navigate to the **Extensions** view in your toolbar\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Search for the Pieces Extension\">\n    Search for Pieces for Visual Studio or navigate to the `Installed` tab and find the **Pieces Extension** in your list of installed extensions, then click `Uninstall`.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/get_started/visual_studio_extension_in_ide.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Restart\">\n    Restart Visual Studio after uninstalling the extension to complete the uninstallation process\n  </Step>\n</Steps>",

Find out more below.\n\n### Ensure You Have the Latest Versions\n\nFirst, ensure you're using the latest version of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.PiecesVisualStudio\">Pieces for Visual Studio Extension</a> from the Visual Studio Marketplace and the newest version of [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os). The minimum supported version is Visual Studio 2022 — 17.9.0 or higher.\n\n### Check the Settings for Pieces\n\nIt's common for users to adjust a setting in Pieces for Visual Studio that leads to unexpected actions. Double-check your [configuration](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/configuration) to ensure everything is set as you expect.\n\n### PiecesOS\n\nPiecesOS and the Pieces Desktop Application update automatically if installed through the Pieces Suite Installer.\n\nFor standalone installations (non-macOS/Linux store-based), updates are checked daily or upon application launch, prompting you to install or delay.\n\nSee your specific OS page for platform-specific instructions on updating PiecesOS:\n\n* [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/macos#updating-piecesos)\n\n* [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/windows#updating-piecesos)\n\n* [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/linux#updating-piecesos)\n\n### Minimum System Requirements for Pieces Software\n\nRegardless of platform, your device should meet the following basic system specifications for using the Pieces for Developers software.\n\n***\n\n| **Component**      | **Minimum**                                                                   | **Recommended**                      | **Notes**                                                        |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| *CPU*              | Any modern CPU                                                                | Multi-core CPU                       | Avoid dual-core processors—aim for at least a 4-core CPU.        |\n| *RAM (Local Mode)* | 8 GB total system RAM with 2 GB free                                          | 16 GB total system RAM or more       | Applies when PiecesOS is running locally.                        |\n| *RAM (Cloud Mode)* | 8 GB total system RAM with 1 GB free                                          | 16 GB total system RAM or more       | Applies when PiecesOS is running in cloud mode.                  |\n| *Disk Space*       | 2 GB minimum (1 GB for PiecesOS + 0.5–1 GB for data), with at least 4 GB free | 8 GB with at least 6 GB free or more | Ensure additional free space for data storage and future growth. |\n\n***\n\n## Checking Hardware\n\nIt may be necessary to verify your system’s specifications if you experience ongoing issues.\n\nSee the OS-specific pages for instructions on how to check CPU, RAM, and GPU details:\n\n* [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/macos#checking-cpu-type)\n\n* [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/windows#checking-hardware-specifications)\n\n* [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/linux#checking-system-information)\n\n### Restart Visual Studio After Updates\n\nIf you’ve recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension, restart the IDE.\n\nContact the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-vscode\">Pieces support team</a> if the issue still persists.\n\n### Refreshing Copilot Chats\n\nYou might need to restart or refresh the Pieces Copilot chat, especially if you're using a cloud LLM and lose your WiFi connection.\n\nThis can sometimes cause the LLM to hang, appearing to generate a response but eventually timing out or getting stuck in a loop.\n\nTo fix this, click the **three vertical dots** in the top-right corner of your Copilot Chat window and select `Refresh`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/troubleshooting/refresh_copilot_chat.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />",

Type and run the `Pieces: Ask Copilot About Selection` command\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Enter Your Prompt\">\n    Type your prompt in the text input field and press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux)\n\n    <Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732738498253/f36bb3c0-3fae-4570-a5a1-b5baa8231d12.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThis approach is ideal for localized queries where you need **quick insights** or **guidance** **on specific code functionality**.\n\n### Pieces: Ask Copilot About Active File\n\nThe `Pieces: Ask About Active File` feature focuses on the current file, offering tailored insights and assistance with debugging.\n\nThere are two ways to access this command:\n\n1. Right-click inside your file and select the `Ask Copilot about Active File`, then enter your query into the dropdown text input field.\n\n2. Open the command palette using `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux) and enter `Pieces: Ask About Active File`.\n\nOnce you've entered your question, the Pieces Copilot will analyze the file's context to deliver precise responses.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/vs_code_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/ask_about_active_file.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nThis feature is useful for better understanding file dependencies, methods, and structure, detecting potential issues, suggesting improvements, and more.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  The `Pieces: Ask About Active File` the feature can also be applied during onboarding to get helpful explanations for unfamiliar code.\n</Callout>\n\n### Pieces: Ask Copilot About Workspace\n\nWith the `Pieces: Ask Copilot About Workspace` command, you can extend the Pieces Copilot’s assistance to fit the project scope.\n\nTo use this command:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the Command Palette\">\n    Open the command palette `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux)\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Enter the Command and Query\">\n    Enter `Pieces: Ask Copilot About Workspace` and type your question\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThis is ideal for large projects where a project-wide perspective is needed, specifically for identifying inconsistencies in naming conventions across multiple files, in error handling, or resolving global code redundancies.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732738797364/b0e79b08-11d3-473a-a10a-daedb1667862.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Adding Context to Copilot Chats\n\nYou can add context to a chat by adding `Files`**,** `Folders`**,** `Snippets`**,** `Websites`**,** and `Messages`**.**\n\nThis flexibility comes in handy when items you want to serve as reference material is not directly accessible from VS Code, or if you want to compartmentalize context and minimize overlap by keeping files or folders from other projects separate from your active file’s workflow.\n\nTo do this, select the Starred Message Icon in the bottom-left corner of your Copilot Chat window, which is openable from the VS Code sidebar.\n\nClick the **Starred Message Icon,** then add whatever context items you need.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/vs_code_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/add_files_to_context.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Adding Code Snippets\n\nYou can paste snippets of code as a code block inside any Copilot Chat by clicking the `{ }` icon inside the chat window, then pasting in your code.\n\nThis is useful for bringing in code that isn’t present immediately in the active file as context, or for comparisons and suggestions.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734126869579/98158d85-2072-4479-8290-069fda210cff.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Extracting Code from Screenshots\n\nYou can also extract code from screenshots directly from the Copilot chat menu by selecting `Extract Code from Screenshot`, selecting the desired screenshot from your **Finder** (macOS) or **File Explorer** (Windows/Linux) menu, and confirming.\n\nPieces Copilot will then scan the screenshot and generate the code captured from the image into the chat, from which you can copy, insert at your cursor, save it as a snippet, and more.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/vs_code_extension_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/extract_code_from_screenshot_vs_code.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Adding Folders from File Explorer\n\nSuppose you right-click on a folder or file in your file explorer in VS Code. In that case, you’ll see three options: `Pieces: Add to Copilot Context`, `Pieces: Ask Copilot` and `Pieces: Save File to Pieces`, so you can take any folder in the project you’re working in and immediately have the Pieces Copilot interact with it.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734128702503/4b2c56b7-8d51-42be-8d3c-f4b13b9f7701.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Adding Pieces MCP\n\nAdding the Pieces MCP to VS Code is simple and enables you to perform a wide range of Pieces actions with the GitHub Copilot.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the Command Palette\">\n    To open the command palette, press `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux).\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Search for MCP: Add Server\">\n    After the command palette opens, enter `MCP: Add Server` and select the option that appears matching that query.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Select HTTP\">\n    In the new MCP menu, select `HTTP (server-ssent events)` and a new menu will appear.\n\n    Enter `http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse` as the URL for the Pieces MCP server. Once the URL is entered, press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux).\n\n    > screenshot of the url entered into the enter server url box\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Name the Server\">\n    After entering your server URL, you can enter a name for the server. It’s recommended to name it `PiecesMCP`, but you can put whatever you’d like here.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Select Workspace\">\n    You will then be prompted to choose workspaces:\n\n    * `User Settings` — Make the MCP available in any project you work on within VS Code.\n\n    * `Workspace Settings` — Save the MCP locally to the current project you’re working on.\n\n    After selecting your workspace, VS Code will open a `settings.json` file. You can manually adjust the MCP server in this file. Otherwise, you can close it.\n\n    > screenshot of the json ?\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Improving Code Consistency & Standardization\n\nThe Pieces Copilot helps improve code quality by identifying inconsistencies and providing actionable suggestions for standardization.\n\n### Naming Inconsistencies\n\nIf functions across your workspace use inconsistent naming patterns (e.g., `authenticateUser` in `authHandler.go` vs. `retrieveUserProfile` in `userHandler.go`), Pieces Copilot can suggest adopting a standardized naming convention for better readability and maintainability, like this:\n\n```c\n// authHandler.go\nfunc authenticateUser(ctx context.Context, credentials Credentials) (User, error) {\n    if credentials.Username == \"\" || credentials.Password == \"\" {\n        return User{}, errors.New(\"missing credentials\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Inconsistent Error Handling\n\nIf error-handling strategies differ across files (e.g., structured errors in `authService.go` vs. inconsistent handling in `userService.go`), Pieces Copilot can help unify the approach:\n\n```c\n// authService.go\nfunc LoginUser(credentials Credentials) (string, error) {\n    token, err := authenticate(credentials)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"login failed: %w\", err)\n    }\n    return token, nil\n}\n```",

The Pieces for VS Code Extension has a *Save Materials* feature to help you do exactly that.\n\nYou can use this feature to save all kinds of useful code materials, like:\n\n* API endpoint definitions\n\n* Utility functions or commonly used helper methods\n\n* Code templates for starting new modules\n\n* Reusable logic for error handling or authentication\n\n## How to Save Materials\n\nThere are three ways to save code with the Pieces for VS Code Extension—through the right-click menu, by saving with hotkeys, or through the Pieces Copilot Chat view.\n\n### via Right-Click Menu\n\nTo capture useful code snippets and save them to your Pieces Drive via the right-click menu:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Choose your Snippet\">\n    Highlight the code you want to save\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Open the Pieces Menu\">\n    Right-click on the highlighted code and hover on the `Pieces` option\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Save your Snippet\">\n    Select either `Save Current Selection to Pieces` or `Save Active File to Pieces`\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/vs_code_extension_assets/using_snippets/saving_snippets/right_click_save_snippet.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThis will trigger a success message in the bottom-right corner of your screen to let you know that the save was successful.\n\n### via Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nIf you’re a developer who avoids using their cursor as much as possible, you can instantly save your selected code using keyboard shortcuts.\n\nTo do this:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Choose your Snippet\">\n    Highlight the code you want to save\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Save your Snippet\">\n    Use the `⌘+shift+v` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows/Linux) shortcut\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/vs_code_extension_assets/using_snippets/saving_snippets/keybind_save_snippet.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### via Copilot Chat\n\nYou can take any code block existing in your Copilot Chat and click `Save to Pieces`—like code generated by Pieces Copilot, code blocks you added as context that weren’t saved as individual snippets, and any other kind of code.\n\nTo do so, click the `Save to Pieces` button on any code block within the Copilot Chat view.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734128918736/49e96fb8-7d25-4f16-96ce-16ed9e3fd6b9.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Saving Active Files to Pieces\n\nIf you want to save a *really* big snippet, try saving your entire file directly to Pieces Drive.\n\nTo save your active file:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Right-Click the File\">\n    Right-click within your active file\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Locate Pieces Options\">\n    Hover over the `Pieces` item\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Save the File\">\n    Click `Save Active File to Pieces`\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/vs_code_extension_assets/using_snippets/saving_snippets/save_active_file_to_pieces.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThere are plenty of scenarios in which saving an entire file to your Pieces Drive is ideal, such as to:\n\n* **Preserve Complex Codebases**: Save larger, cohesive files like utility libraries, configuration files, or classes to ensure you capture all interconnected functionality in one place.\n\n* **Reuse in Future Projects**: Easily repurpose full files in new projects without reconstructing smaller snippets.\n\n* **Keep Independent Files Versioned**: Maintain standalone files, such as scripts or tools, as independent backups or versions outside of source control.\n\n## What’s Stored When You Save a Snippet\n\nWhen you save a snippet to your Pieces Drive, it’s more than just the code that gets stored.\n\nThe Pieces Copilot captures:\n\n* `Type`: Categorizes the snippet (e.g., API call, function, class) with it’s code language.\n\n* `Associated Tags`: Keywords associated with the snippet for easier searching.\n\n* `Custom Description`**:** Specifies precisely which *lines* (in numerical form) the snippet is from, as well as the file from which it originated—very useful for mind-mapping.\n\n* `Smart Description`: AI-generated descriptions that summarize the snippet’s purpose and function.\n\n* `Suggested Searches`: Related searches that help you discover similar snippets.\n\n* `Related Links`: References to documentation, code repositories, or other relevant resources.\n\n* `Related People`: Associated collaborators or contributors.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732741621504/140ab238-3a62-45cd-b454-a56e2dca5d0c.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nAdditionally, the Pieces Copilot **scans saved snippets for sensitive information**, such as API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens, to ensure no confidential data is accidentally stored.\n\n## Where Saved Snippets Live\n\nSaved snippets are stored locally on your device, ensuring accessibility even when offline. This also means that any Pieces for Developers extension or plugin—or even the Pieces Desktop App—has constant, up-to-date access to your saved materials with Pieces Drive.\n\nThere are two ways to find your saved snippets—via the `Pieces Drive` menu, or with the `Pieces: Search Pieces` feature.\n\n[Read more about how to find your saved snippets here.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/search-reuse#finding-saved-snippets)",

members](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/sharing#how-to-share-a-saved-snippet), even if they don’t use Pieces.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  You can send a shareable link containing your code snippet to anyone, even if they don’t use Pieces or have a Pieces for Developers account.\n</Callout>\n\nSharing bits of code you find useful can remove productivity blockers if co-developer is unfamiliar with the project, or if they’re a junior.\n\nFor example, a teammate working on server monitoring can use your shared script to automate daily tasks without additional setup.\n\nThese shared links also include their [original enriched metadata](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet), like tags, descriptions, and other information.\n\nTo share

Code Extension, your snippets become a robust library of reusable code that you can organize, search, edit, and share across projects.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use them:\n\n### Reusable Scheduling Functions\n\nImagine you’re frequently working on projects that involve scheduling tasks at regular intervals.\n\nInstead of rewriting the same logic for each new project, you can [save an evergreen snippet to your Pieces Drive.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets)\n\nThis allows you to reuse a well-crafted scheduling function across multiple applications that’s useful in a variety of scenarios:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\n// A reusable function to schedule tasks at a specified interval\nfunc scheduleTask(interval time.Duration, task func()) {\n\tticker := time.NewTicker(interval)\n\tdefer ticker.Stop()\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase <-ticker.C:\n\t\t\ttask()\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### File System Monitoring\n\nIf you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets) that does exactly that, using generic and reusable naming conventions:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n\n// A reusable function to monitor file system changes\nfunc watchFileChanges(path string) {\n\twatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer watcher.Close()\n\n\terr = watcher.Add(path)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase event := <-watcher.Events:\n\t\t\tif event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Modified file:\", event.Name)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tcase err := <-watcher.Errors:\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## **Additional Snippet Scenarios**\n\nRead up on some additional scenarios and use

This is *required* for the MCP server to communicate with your personal repository of workflow data and pass context through to the Cursor chat agent.\n\n    If you do not have PiecesOS, you can download it alongside the [Pieces Desktop App](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/download) or [install it standalone](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/manual-installation#manual-download--installation) here.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Enable Long-Term Memory\">\n    For the MCP server to interact with your workflow context, you must enable the Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) through the Pieces Desktop App or the [PiecesOS Quick Menu](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu) in your toolbar.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Installing PiecesOS & Configuring Permissions\n\nFollow the instructions below for a detailed guide on setting up and configuring PiecesOS to correctly pass captured workflow context to the Pieces MCP server.\n\n<pos-download-guide />\n\n### Getting the SSE Endpoint for PiecesOS\n\nTo use Pieces MCP with Cursor, you'll first need the Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint from PiecesOS:\n\n```markdown\nhttp://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse\n```\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  Keep in mind that the **specific port** (i.e., `39300`) PiecesOS is running on **may vary**.\n</Callout>\n\nTo find the current SSE endpoint with the active instance of POS (including the current port number), open the PiecesOS Quick Menu and expand the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** tab.\n\nThere, you can click once to copy the SSE endpoint, which includes the active PiecesOS port number.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_pos_new.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nYou can also do this in the Pieces Desktop App by opening the **Settings** view and clicking **Model Context Protocol (MCP).**\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_pfd_new.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Setting Up Cursor\n\nRead below for steps on setting up the Pieces MCP in your Cursor IDE using the global MCP configuration method—or watch the video below for a tutorial and live demo.\n\n<Embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joqJbr9MV8k\" />\n\n### via Global MCP Configuration\n\nTo set up the Pieces MCP, you can edit the `.json` settings configuration file from within **Cursor Settings.**\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Go to Settings\">\n    Navigate to **Cursor Settings**, then to the `MCP` section.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_cursor/cursor_no_mcp.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Add a New MCP\">\n    Add a new global MCP server by clicking `Add new global MCP server` and inserting the following `.json` snippet (adjust port if necessary) in the `.json` file that opens:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"Pieces\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Save the File\">\n    Save the configuration file.\n\n    Make sure to refresh the MCP server window by clicking the **refresh icon** and ensure that there is a *green dot* indicating that the server is running and functioning without errors.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_cursor/cursor_green_dot_mcp.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Use Pieces MCP\">\n    Once the MCP server is set up, make sure to change the chat mode to *Agent* mode. This should automatically utilize the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Using Pieces MCP Server in Cursor\n\nOnce integrated, you can utilize [Pieces LTM](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2) directly in Cursor through the built-in chat agent.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the Chat Panel\">\n    Open the right-hand chat panel by toggling it at the top-right corner, or use the shortcut `⌘+i` (macOS) or `ctrl+i` (Windows/Linux).\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Select ‘Cursor Agent’\">\n    Make sure that you are using the *Cursor Agent* mode, not *Ask* or *Manual.* This is required to use the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool to access context from LTM.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Begin Prompting\">\n    From this point, you can begin prompting. If PiecesOS was previously installed, try testing out the Pieces MCP integration with a prompt like, “What was I doing for work yesterday?” and click `Use Tool` when prompted.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_cursor/example_pieces_mcp_cursor.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Card title=\"Hey!\" image=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1744223623563/b3f5f845-6e45-47be-8473-3f1173e1c415.png\">\n  Check out this [MCP-specific prompting guide](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/prompting) if you want to effectively utilize the Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) with your new Pieces MCP server.\n</Card>\n\n### Configuring Rules\n\nIf you want to customize the specific output provided by the Cursor chatbot through working with the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool, you can manually adjust the *rules* for inside of **Cursor Settings.**\n\nTo do this, open up **Cursor Settings,** click `Rules`, then add new *User Rules.*\n\nHere’s an example of a straightforward set of rules tailored to a specific use case and work flow:\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_cursor/cursor_rules.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you’re experiencing issues integrating Pieces MCP with Cursor, follow these troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Verify PiecesOS Status**: Ensure [PiecesOS is actively running](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/troubleshooting) on your system. MCP integration requires PiecesOS to be operational.\n\n2. **Confirm LTM Engine Activation**: Make sure the [Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) is enabled in PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#ltm-2-engine), as this engine aggregates context necessary for Cursor to retrieve accurate results.\n\n3. **Single MCP Instance:** Make sure that you aren’t testing multiple instances of the Pieces MCP server in different IDEs. This cross-contamination conflict with the SSE and several MCP instances running on the same port can cause issues in different development environments.\n\n4. **Use Agent Mode in Chat**: Cursor must be in *Agent Mode*, not *Ask Mode*, to access the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool. Switch to Agent Mode to enable full MCP integration.\n\n5. **Turn Off Auto-Select**: If Cursor is having issues finding the Pieces tool, de-select `auto-select` and select an individual Agent, such as `claude-3.5-sonnet`.\n\n6. **Check MCP Server Status**: If you’re encountering messages such as “Sorry, I can’t do this,” your MCP server may not be properly configured or running.\n\n7. **Go to** `settings.json` **in Cursor:** Confirm the MCP server status shows \"running\" (it may say \"start\" or \"pause\" otherwise). Restart the server if necessary and inspect terminal outputs for error messages.\n\n8. **Review Configuration Details**: Double-check the MCP endpoint URL and the port number in Cursor settings to ensure accuracy, You can find the current SSE endpoint URL in the Pieces Desktop App under **Settings** → **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, or in the PiecesOS Quick Menu. It is usually formatted as:\n\n```scss\nhttp://localhost:{port_number}/model_context_protocol/{version}/sse\n```\n\n### JSON Blob Error in MCP Settings\n\nWhen you open **Preferences → Settings → MCP**, you may see a raw `.JSON` payload or *“unknown message ID”* error displayed beneath your enabled Pieces server—even though your tool calls work correctly.\n\nCursor’s *Settings* UI currently doesn’t recognize the JSON-RPC success envelope, so it misclassifies the response as an error object and dumps the payload.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_cursor/cursor_error.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nThis visual artifact is harmless. All genuine LTM responses still arrive properly in the Cursor chat window.\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  Ignore any red `.JSON` blobs in the MCP Settings view. The **Chat** pane is the source of truth—if your pieces queries return formatted summaries there, the integration is functioning normally.\n</Callout>\n\n***\n\nYou’re now set to enhance your workflow with powerful context retrieval through Pieces MCP integrated seamlessly into Cursor.

MCP integration requires PiecesOS to be operational.\n\n2. **Confirm LTM Engine Activation**: Make sure the [Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) is enabled in PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#ltm-2-engine), as this engine aggregates context necessary for Cursor to retrieve accurate results.\n\n3. **Use Agent Mode in Chat**: Cursor must be in *Agent*, not *Ask*, to access the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool. Switch to Agent to enable full MCP integration. Make sure *not to add* the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool as context—instead, rely solely on the *Agent* chat mode.\n\n4. **Single MCP Instance:** Make sure that you aren’t testing multiple instances of the Pieces MCP server in different IDEs. This cross-contamination conflict with the SSE and several MCP instances running on the same port can cause issues in different development environments.\n\n5. **Check MCP Server Status**: If you’re encountering messages such as “Sorry, I can’t do this,” your MCP server may not be properly configured or running.\n\n6. **Go to** `settings.json` **in Visual Studio Code:** Confirm the MCP server status shows \"running\" (it may say \"start\" or \"pause\" otherwise). Restart the server if necessary and inspect terminal outputs for error messages.\n\n7. **Review Configuration Details**: Double-check the MCP endpoint URL and the port number in your VS Code MCP configuration menu to ensure accuracy. You can find the current SSE endpoint URL in the Pieces Desktop App under **Settings** → **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, or in the PiecesOS Quick Menu. It is usually formatted as:\n\n```scss\nhttp://localhost:{port_number}/model_context_protocol/{version}/sse\n```\n\n***\n\nYou're now ready to improve your workflow with powerful context retrieval using Pieces MCP, seamlessly integrated into Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot.

This *cross-contamination conflict* with the SSE and several MCP instances running on the same port can cause issues in different development environments.\n\n4. **Check MCP Server Status:** If you're encountering messages such as \"Sorry, I can't do this,\" your MCP server may not be properly configured or running.\n\n5. **Verify Port Configuration:** Double-check the MCP endpoint URL and the port number in your Goose configuration to ensure accuracy. You can find the current SSE endpoint URL in the Pieces Desktop App under **Settings → Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, or in the PiecesOS Quick Menu. It is usually formatted as:\n\n```plaintext\nhttp://localhost:{port_number}/model_context_protocol/{version}/sse\n```\n\n6. **Mac PATH Issues:** If you're having trouble with Goose CLI on macOS, try manually adding it to your PATH:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\n7. **Restart Services:** If problems persist, try restarting both PiecesOS and Goose, then reconfigure the extension with the current port number.\n\n8. **Use the Correct Mode:** You can experience a blockage of LTM data if you are using *any other chat mode* than **Auto** mode. Make sure to use `goose configure` to change chat modes to avoid issues.\n\n***\n\nYou're now set to enhance your workflow with powerful context retrieval through Pieces MCP integrated seamlessly into Goose. Happy coding!",

Make the relevant update in my package manifest.\"*\n\n* **Outcome:** Pieces MCP retrieves Mark's requested package version update from your context, then automatically directs the agent to apply this update to your `package.json` manifest.\n\n## Effective Prompting Tips\n\nSometimes, it can be challenging to create a prompt that gets you exactly what you need.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  When using Pieces, especially with its large, on-device repository of personalized workflow data, it's best to use more specific prompts.\n</Callout>\n\nUse these techniques and tips to refine your prompting:\n\n* Clearly specify *timeframes*.\n\n* Mention relevant *applications*.\n\n* Include *technical keywords* relevant to your query.\n\n* Refer explicitly to *open files* when relevant.\n\n* Ask *follow-up questions* for refined results.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  If you want to read more information on LTM prompting, [check out this guide.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-prompting)\n</Callout>\n\n### Examples of Effective Prompts\n\nCheck out these example prompts to see how to effectively combine parameters for specific AI outputs using the Pieces MCP for your Agent.\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Development Context\">\n    * “Show examples of React Context usage.\"\n\n    * \"What was my last implementation of API error handling?\"\n\n    * “Have I previously optimized rendering performance in React components?”\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Project History\">\n    * \"Track the evolution of the dashboard feature.\"\n\n    * \"Review documented challenges with the payment system.\"\n\n    * “Show the decisions made around UI updates for the onboarding flow.”\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Learning Retrieval\">\n    * \"Find recent bookmarks about Kubernetes.\"\n\n    * What resources did I save recently related to Python decorators?”\n\n    * “Show notes taken about GraphQL in March.”\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Code & Collaboration\">\n    * “Show code review comments related to database indexing.”\n\n    * “Did we finalize naming conventions for the latest API endpoints?”\n\n    * “What feedback did I leave on recent pull requests?”\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>",

Restart PiecesOS\n\n2. Ensure PiecesOS is running (look for the Pieces Icon in your system tray or menu bar)\n\n3. Check for and install available updates\n\n4. Verify that the Pieces Desktop Application and the plugin or extension you are attempting to use is up-to-date\n\n## Common Installation Issues\n\nCommon issues can occur when setting up PiecesOS and the Pieces Desktop App for the first time.\n\nPlatform-specific solutions are detailed on their respective OS pages:\n\n* [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/macos#common-installation-issues)\n\n* [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/windows#common-installation-issues)\n\n* [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/linux#common-installation-issues)\n\n## Using Local Models\n\nRunning Pieces software with a local LLM through **Ollama** can offer greater privacy, faster responses (when properly configured), and independence from cloud dependencies.\n\nBy utilizing the Ollama framework, users can efficiently deploy and manage local language models tailored to their needs.\n\nHowever, local models often require robust hardware configurations and careful optimization to run smoothly.\n\nOlder devices, regardless of operating system, may struggle to meet the hardware demands of these LLMs, even with Ollama's streamlined setup.\n\n### Minimum System Requirements\n\nLocal models demand more from your system than their cloud-hosted counterparts.\n\nTo ensure a stable, responsive experience—make sure your device fits these general minimum device specifications, pulled from Ollama documentation and other experience-tested public sources.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Operating System\">\n    Ollama is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux devices—but you need to make sure your operating system is running at the correct minimum version to avoid compatibility issues.\n\n    * **macOS:** macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or higher\n\n    * **Windows:** Windows 10 or higher\n\n    * **Linux:** Ubuntu 22+ or higher\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"RAM\">\n    Your system should have a minimum amount of RAM depending on the local model you’re trying to run. More RAM may further improve performance and reduce bottlenecks.\n\n    * **3B Models:** 8GB of RAM\n\n    * **7B Models:** 16GB of RAM\n\n    * **13B Models:** 32GB of RAM\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"CPU\">\n    If your system doesn’t have a dedicated or otherwise capable GPU, running a CPU-tuned model may be in your best interests.\n\n    * **Recommended:** Any modern CPU with at least 4 cores\n\n    * **13B Models:** Any modern CPU with at least 8 cores\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"GPU\">\n    While you don’t need a GPU to run a local Ollama model as long as the LLM is CPU-tuned, a GPU can significantly speed up inference and the training of custom models.\n\n    * **Recommended:** Any modern GPU with at least 6GB of VRAM\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Disk Space\">\n    Local large language models can occupy significant disk space, so ensure you have enough capacity for both the core installation and any custom models you plan to download or train.\n\n    * **Minimum:** At least 12GB of free storage space for installing Ollama and other base models.\n\n    * **Additional Storage:** Required for larger models that have additional dependencies\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Minimum System Requirements for Pieces Software\n\nYour device, regardless of platform, should meet the following basic system specifications for using Pieces for Developers software.\n\n<pos-pfd-system-reqs />\n\n### Choosing the Right Model\n\nSelect a model that matches your system’s capabilities and performance limitations, especially if you’re running an older or weaker device.\n\n* **Lightweight Models:** Opt for smaller or **quantized models** if you’re using older hardware or have limited VRAM. Quantized models are optimized to reduce memory usage, making them easier to run without significantly impacting output quality for general tasks.\n\n* **GPU-Tuned Models:** If you have a strong GPU with enough VRAM, GPU-accelerated models often run faster and produce results more efficiently.\n\n* **CPU-Tuned Models:** If you lack a dedicated GPU or have low GPU memory, CPU-tuned models are a fallback option. Although slower, they can still provide consistent performance.\n\n### Local Model Crashing\n\nIf you are running into ‘hanging’ or crashing issues when attempting to power Pieces using a local LLM, it may be because of your system’s hardware.\n\nInsufficient system resources, like RAM or VRAM may cause hiccups, slowdowns, and other glitches.\n\nThere are a few options available to you for troubleshooting:\n\n1. **Check Hardware:** Verify that you have sufficient RAM, VRAM, and CPU headroom as recommended by the model.\n\n2. **Update Drivers:** Run `vulkaninfo` (or a similar tool) to check for GPU or Vulkan-related errors, if you have a Vulkan-based GPU. Update your GPU drivers if you detect compatibility issues.\n\n3. **Model Switching:** If you experience crashes or slowdowns, try switching to a less resource-intensive local model. Reducing complexity can stabilize performance.\n\nIf you’ve tried all of these troubleshooting steps but are still experiencing crashes, hanging-time, or other instabilities, you may need to switch to a cloud-based LLM.\n\n## Vulkan-based GPUs\n\nNVIDIA and AMD both utilize the Vulkan API framework in their GPUs, but there are known issues with using Vulkan GPUs for AI and LLM-centered workloads.\n\nFor example, a corrupted or outdated Vulkan API can cause crashes.\n\nIf you are experiencing this issue, you can check Vulkan health in your terminal or command line and scanning for errors or warning message—if there are any issues detected, **update your GPU drivers.**\n\n### Checking Vulkan\n\nTo check your Vulkan health status, run `vulkaninfo` in your terminal or command line and look for errors or warnings.\n\n### Updating GPU Drivers\n\nIf issues are detected, update your GPU drivers to ensure Vulkan compatibility and stability.\n\n## Checking Hardware\n\nIt may be necessary to verify your system’s specifications if you experience ongoing issues.\n\nSee the OS-specific pages for instructions on how to check CPU, RAM, and GPU details:\n\n* [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/macos#checking-cpu-type)\n\n* [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/windows#checking-hardware-specifications)\n\n* [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/linux#checking-system-information)",

Click the **Apple** icon in the top-left corner of your screen\n\n2. Select `About This Mac`\n\n3. Under your device name (i.e., MacBook Air), look for the last line on the list, titled `macOS`\n\nThe `macOS` line will report what version of macOS installed, e.g., `Sequoia 15.1.1`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/meet_pieces_assets/meet_pieces/troubleshooting/macos/macos_checking_about_mac.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Checking CPU Type\n\nIntel and Apple Silicon (ARM) devices run on entirely separate CPU architectures, so downloading the wrong package for your Apple device can cause apps from the Pieces Suite to be rendered useless.\n\nTo determine what CPU architecture your Apple device utilizes:\n\n1. Click the **Apple () icon** in the top-left corner of your screen.\n\n2. Select **About This Mac**, and look for the **Overview section.** The first line will contain your CPU type:\n\n* **Apple Silicon / ARM:** You will see an M-Series processor, e.g., `Apple M3`\n\n* **Intel:** You will see an Intel processor, e.g., `2.6 GHz Intel Core i7`\n\nOnce you’ve determined your CPU architecture, [download the correct installation package accordingly.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/macos-installation-guide#recommended-installation-method)\n\n## Restart & Retry\n\nIf installation fails due to having an outdated version of macOS or installing the wrong package for your device’s architecture, restart your machine and try the installation again from scratch.\n\nIf the problem persists, please open a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues\">GitHub issue</a> for further assistance, or book a call with our engineers.",

Click the **Start** button, then select `Settings`\n\n2. Click `Windows Update`\n\n3. Install any pending updates and restart your computer\n\n### Updating the Microsoft Store & App Installer\n\n1. Open the **Microsoft Store**\n\n2. Click on `Library` to check for available updates\n\n3. Update the Microsoft Store and the App Installer if prompted\n\n4. Retry installing the Pieces Suite\n\n## Checking Hardware Specifications\n\nIt may be necessary to verify your system’s specifications if you experience ongoing issues, especially when attempting to utilize local LLMs.\n\nTo check your device specifications on Windows:\n\n* Press the `Windows` key on your keyboard, or the `Windows` icon in the taskbar\n\n* Type `run` and hit `enter`\n\n* Type `dxdiag` and press enter on, or click, the blue `OK` button\n\nThe **System** tab displays your processor, the number of CPU cores, and memory (RAM), while the **Display** tab lists your GPU, its manufacturer (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, etc.), and the available video memory (VRAM).\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/meet_pieces_assets/meet_pieces/troubleshooting/windows/windows_checking_hardware_specs.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n[Read documentation on the minimum recommended hardware specifications across all OS platforms.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/cross-platform#hardware-recommendations)\n\n### Checking Windows Version\n\nIf the Pieces Installer is not working as intended, you could have an outdated version of Windows. The minimum Windows version that Pieces will run on is **Windows 10 20H0 or higher**.\n\nTo check what version of Windows you’re running:\n\n* Press the `Windows` and the `R` keys simultaneously on your keyboard\n\n* A new window will pop up, type `winver` and press `Enter`\n\nA new window will open called **About Windows**, which will display your current Windows version.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/meet_pieces_assets/meet_pieces/troubleshooting/windows/checking_windows_ver.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  If this doesn't work, you're likely using a Windows version older than Windows 10.\n</Callout>\n\n## Restart & Retry\n\nIf the problem persists, please open a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/support/issues\">GitHub issue</a> for further assistance or book a call with our engineers.",

[Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2)](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#ltm-2): A powerful, AI-powered live context framework that understands what you’re working on across your entire development workflow. The LTM-2 helps by outsourcing the burden of memory and retrieval from the developer to AI to maximize space for creativity driven by human intent.\n\n2. [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-drive): The ability to save, search, reference, reuse, and share small developer resources like code snippets, screenshots, links, and text notes.\n\n3. [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-copilot): An intelligent assistant that helps with generating code, answering questions, and adding code comments while utilizing a LLM of your choice—featuring an adjustable context window ranging from conversation-only to entire project repositories.\n\n### Who is Pieces For?\n\nTo put it simply, Pieces is built from the ground up for developers who frequently reference or reuse small developer materials like code snippets or are looking to pick up where they left off and preserve the context of their workflow.\n\nPieces is an **excellent productivity option for developers of all levels** and across various fields, including front-end developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, and students.\n\nIf you find yourself …\n\n1. **Preserving Workflow Context:** If you’re wondering where you left off with trying to untangle that permissions mess in Google Cloud Console or Firestore database, the [LTM-2](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#ltm-2) is an invaluable resource that can provide deep-links and anchors in the form of URLs and other helpful context.\n\n2. **Managing Developer Materials**: If you find yourself needing to repurpose or refresh your memory with small developer resources throughout your workflow, the [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-drive) can help you stay organized while providing an efficient pipeline for referencing and reusing them.\n\n3. **Needing Code Assistance:** Stuck on a bug, or don’t know how to solve a complex algorithmic efficiency problem? Can’t center that `div`? Ask [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-copilot) to help you understand your function, script, code file or entire project and generate code to insert directly into your active file.\n\n… then Pieces is intelligently designed with *you,* the developer, in mind.\n\nLet Pieces do the heavy lifting and preserve your engineering creativity and ingenuity for where you need it most.\n\n### How do I Use Pieces?\n\nPiecesOS serves as the foundational layer of the entire Pieces for Developers Suite, much like Docker does for containerized applications—it powers the Pieces Desktop App along with all our browser and IDE extensions and plugins.\n\nBy installing PiecesOS, you enable the full functionality of the desktop app and our extensions, just like how Docker manages various containers.\n\nWe designed it this way to ensure that your data—including machine learning processes and inter-app communications—remains on-device, secure, private, and local.\n\nClick one of the links below to fast-forward to the Pieces Suite installation guide for your operating system:\n\n* [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/macos-installation-guide)\n\n* [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/windows-installation-guide)\n\n* [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/linux-installation-guide)\n\n<Callout type=\"alert\">\n  PiecesOS is required for any Pieces Software to work, including the Pieces Desktop App.\n\n  However, the Pieces Desktop App is not itself required—but it is recommended to install both PiecesOS and the Pieces Desktop App.\n</Callout>",

You can copy, insert it at your cursor, save it as a snippet, and more.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/obsidian_plugin_assets/pieces_copilot/chat/extract_text_from_image.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Adding Folders from File Explorer\n\nSuppose you right-click on a folder in Obsidian’s file explorer. In that case, you’ll see the following options: `Pieces: Add Vault to Copilot Context` and `Pieces: Add File to Copilot Context`, so you can take any folder or file in the project you’re working in and immediately have the Pieces Copilot interact with it.\n\n## Improving Code Consistency & Standardization\n\nThe Pieces Copilot helps improve code quality by identifying inconsistencies and providing actionable suggestions for standardization.\n\n### Naming Inconsistencies\n\nSuppose functions across your workspace use inconsistent naming patterns (e.g., `authenticateUser` in `authHandler.go` vs. `retrieveUserProfile `in `userHandler.go`). In that case, can suggest adopting a standardized naming convention for better readability and maintainability, like this:\n\n```c\nfunc authenticateUser(ctx context.Context, credentials Credentials) (User, error) {\n    if credentials.Username == \"\" || credentials.Password == \"\" {\n        return User{}, errors.New(\"missing credentials\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Inconsistent Error Handling\n\nIf error-handling strategies differ across files (e.g., structured errors in `authService.go` vs. inconsistent handling in `userService.go`), Pieces Copilot can help unify the approach:\n\n```c\nfunc LoginUser(credentials Credentials) (string, error) {\n    token, err := authenticate(credentials)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"login failed: %w\", err)\n    }\n    return token, nil\n}\n```",

This also means that any Pieces for Developers extension or plugin—or even the Pieces Desktop App—has constant, up-to-date access to your saved materials.\n\nThere are two ways to find your saved snippets—via the `Pieces Explorer` menu, or with the `Pieces: Search Pieces` feature.\n\n[Read more about how to find your saved snippets here.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/search-reuse#finding-saved-snippets)",

From there, you can press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to view your snippet, complete with all its saved context, rendered neatly inside the editor.\n\n### Sharing\n\nShare your snippets directly with team members in Obsidian, even if they don’t use Pieces.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  This can be done without the recipient needing a Pieces for Developers Account.\n</Callout>\n\nSharing useful bits of code can help remove productivity blockers, especially if a co-developer is unfamiliar with the project or if they’re a junior developer.\n\nFor example, a teammate working on server monitoring can use your shared script to automate daily tasks without additional setup.\n\nThese shared links also retain their [original enriched metadata](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet), including tags, descriptions, and other information, making it easier for teammates to understand and utilize the code.\n\nTo share a snippet in Obsidian, highlight the text you’d like to share, right-click, and click `Share Via Pieces Link`.\n\nThis generates a link you can share with teammates, ensuring easy access to your reusable code.\n\n<Image src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732741148257/c227792e-1abb-432e-9b46-15a486403994.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWith the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin, [your snippets become a powerful library](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) of reusable code. You can organize, search, edit, and share them across your projects, all within the Pieces Drive.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use them:\n\n### Reusable Code Snippets for Data Science\n\nIf you frequently work on complex data science projects, algorithm design, or data processing pipelines, you can save reusable code snippets in your Pieces Drive.\n\nThese snippets can be easily imported into Obsidian to document workflows, analyze results, and iterate on solutions in future projects.\n\n```python\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  \n\ndata.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  \n \nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler  \nscaler = MinMaxScaler()  \ndata[['feature1', 'feature2']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['feature1', 'feature2']])  \n\nprint(data.describe())  \n```\n\n### Code Snippet Documentation\n\nSuppose you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes. In that case, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/save-snippets) that does precisely that, allowing you to import it over to Obsidian for documenting it:\n\n```go\n\nfunc watchFileChanges(path string) {\n\twatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer watcher.Close()\n\n\terr = watcher.Add(path)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase event := <-watcher.Events:\n\t\t\tif event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Modified file:\", event.Name)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tcase err := <-watcher.Errors:\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Snippet Scenarios\n\nReview some additional scenarios and use cases for Pieces Drive and see how the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=pieces-for-developers\">Pieces for Obsidian Plugin</a> could benefit you and your workflow.\n\n***\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Testing Framework Templates\">\n    Streamline testing by saving snippets for your frequently used testing functions or unit test templates.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Command-Line Utilities\">\n    Save command-line instructions as snippets to quickly retrieve deployment commands, Docker setups, and other essential terminal operations.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Error Handling & Logging\">\n    You can also save standard logging functions or error-handling snippets that can be reused across applications, promoting consistent error management.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Quickly Create New Projects\">\n    Import saved setup scripts, configuration files, and commonly used dependencies to speed up project setup and ensure consistency across new projects.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n***\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=pieces-for-developers\">Download the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin today!</a>",

It must be active for the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin to function properly.\n\n### Restart Obsidian After Updates\n\nIf you’ve recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin, restart Obsidian to apply the updates properly.\n\nIf the issue still persists, contact the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-obsidian\">Pieces support team</a>.\n\n### Refreshing Copilot Chats\n\nIf you're using the Pieces Copilot chat and disconnect from WiFi or encounter issues with a cloud-based LLM, you may need to refresh the chat. This can resolve issues such as the LLM appearing to \"hang\" (e.g., generating a response that turns out to be an infinite loop).\n\nClick the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of your Copilot Chat window and select **Refresh**.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/obsidian_plugin_assets/troubleshooting/refresh_copilot_chat_OBS.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />",

You can then combine this with your code, allowing Pieces to guide you on implementing the issue, all from within your IDE!\n\n### Review a GitHub Issue\n\nThe first step is to review the issue by letting Pieces capture it, and then ask the Pieces Copilot about it.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Review the GitHub Issue\">\n    Open the following GitHub issue in your browser. Slowly scroll through the comments on the issue, taking maybe 30 seconds or so to scroll through it.\\\n    \\\n    You can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/pieces-certification-course-content/issues/1\">use this issue</a> as an example.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Ask Pieces About the Issue\">\n    In the Pieces Copilot, start a new chat, ensuring the Long-Term Memory (LTM) context is enabled, and use the following prompt:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    Summarize the create a sign up page issue I was just reading\n    ```\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nPieces will respond with a summary of the issue:\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/quick_guides/using_pieces_copilot_with_memory_context/summarize_this_issue_demo.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Clone the Project\n\nThis issue refers to a sci-fi store—a small web application written in Python and Flask for an upcoming retail store that sells themed sci-fi toys.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Clone the Project Repo\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pieces-app/pieces-certification-course-content\">Clone this GitHub repository.</a>\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Navigate to the Sci-Fi Store folder\">\n    Inside the repo is a folder called `scifi_store`.\n\n    If you use an IDE like VS Code or JetBrains PyCharm, open this folder in that IDE.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Use the Project as Context\n\nThe next step is to add the project as context to the Pieces Copilot chat. This lets you link the project to the Long-Term Memory and ask questions about the code.\n\nAdding the project as context to your Pieces Copilot Chat will look a little different depending on whether you’re using the Pieces Desktop App or an IDE with the respective Pieces plugin or extension installed,such as VS Code.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"via Pieces Desktop App\">\n    From the Pieces Desktop App, select the `Manage Conversation Context `button, then select `Add Folders`.\n\n    From the `Manage Copilot Context | Folders` dialog, select `Add Folders`.\n\n    Select the `scifi_store` folder in the repository you cloned in the previous step.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/quick_guides/using_pieces_copilot_with_memory_context/add_as_context_PFD.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"via VS Code with Pieces Installed\">\n    From the **Explorer**, right-click on the pane itself (not on a file or folder), and select `Pieces`, then click `Pieces: Add to Copilot Context`.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/quick_guides/using_pieces_copilot_with_memory_context/add_as_context_VSC.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Prompt Pieces Copilot\n\nNow that Pieces has the issue from the Long-Term Memory and the project folder as context, you can ask Pieces to implement this issue.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Ask Pieces how to Implement the Issue\">\n    In the same Pieces Copilot chat, use this prompt (or one like it):\n\n    ```plaintext\n    How can I implement this issue in this project?\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Check the Response\">\n    The Pieces Copilot will now reason over your project, as well as the GitHub issue you were looking at.\n\n    The response will contain relevant instructions on how to implement this issue, such as code for the endpoint, the new page leveraging the existing app templates, and so on.\n\n    Review these code changes along with the original codebase.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/quick_guides/using_pieces_copilot_with_memory_context/implem_in_project.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  🎉 Congratulations, you’ve completed the *Using Pieces Copilot with Context* Quick Guide! 🎉\n</Callout>\n\n## Bonus—Try One Prompt\n\nThis Quick Guide showed two prompts: one to get the details about the issue and another to learn how to implement it.\n\nThis was done in 2 stages to illustrate the information from the Pieces Long-Term Memory, but is *unnecessary*. You can do this in a single prompt!\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create a New Copilot Chat\">\n    Create a new Pieces Copilot Chat in the Pieces Desktop App, or in your IDE.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Add the Project Folder as Context\">\n    Add the `scifi_store` project as context to this new Pieces Copilot Chat.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt Pieces Copilot\">\n    Use this single prompt when interacting with Pieces Copilot;\n\n    ```plaintext\n    How can I implement the create a sign up page issue I was just reading in this Python project?\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Check the Response\">\n    The Pieces Copilot will now reason over your project, as well as the GitHub issue, and give you suggestions on how to implement it.\n\n    <Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/quick_guides/using_pieces_copilot_with_memory_context/dual_prompt.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n  </Step>\n</Steps>",

    "content": "***\n\n## In This Guide\n\nThere are many ways to use and prompt LTM to find specific information, recall past fixes and solutions, refresh your memory from conversations and shared resources, and much more.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll find some carefully selected use cases and examples that our users commonly rely on—but this is just the beginning.\n\n## Summarize & Extract Information\n\nIf you're reading a document in your browser, a PDF viewer, or a collaboration tool like Teams, Pieces is reading along with you. This means you can use Pieces to summarize or extract information from those documents.\n\nTry using these prompts to recall information captured by LTM while you were reading text in a browser or application related to your workflow.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #1\">\n    “Summarize the Project Falcon report I was reading last week.”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #2\">\n    “I was reading a Red Team huddle report yesterday. What were the items on the agenda and who were they assigned to?”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #3\">\n    “Last month I was looking at documentation on the Endor API. What is the API endpoint to open the bunker?”\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Get Deep Link URLs\n\nWhen Pieces captures context from your browser, it saves the URL you were visiting.\n\nIt also captures links from other content where the URL is present in the text, so you can search for URLs, such as finding tabs you no longer have open or retrieving links mentioned in chats or emails.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  Note that Pieces is not a search engine—it captures *memories* from your activities. It will return the URLs you viewed, interacted with, or were shared with you, but it doesn't perform web searches.\n</Callout>\n\nUse similar prompts that include a little context, so LTM knows what information to surface and return to the Pieces Copilot.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #1\">\n    “Give me the URL of the Yavin JavaScript framework I was reading about this morning.”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #2\">\n    “What is the URL for the Power Converter documentation I was reading last week?”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #3\">\n    “I need the URL that Leia shared with me with the GCP Firestore database containing the plans.”\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Research an Error in Code\n\nWhen you encounter an error in your code, whether it's in your terminal, a popup in your IDE, or an error in your browser, Pieces captures it.\n\n* If it's an error you've seen *before*, you can ask about it to recall what you did to fix it.\n\n* If it's a *new* error, you can use Long-Term Memory along with file or folder context to help find a solution in your codebase.\n\nOne of the most powerful applications of LTM context and the Pieces Copilot is to facilitate intelligent debugging regarding your recent or active development workflow.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #1\">\n    “What was the error I just saw in VS Code? Summarize some of the reasons I may have got this error and give me suggestions to resolve it.”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #2\">\n    “I just had an error log in my browser. What was the error and what file did it reference?”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #3\">\n    “How can I fix the error I just got in Warp in this project? *(Using the project as a folder of context)”*\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Summarize Recent Work\n\nKnowledge workers often have to provide status updates, such as reports on the work they have been doing or the status of a project.\n\nFor example, developers often attend a daily standup where they list the tasks they worked on the previous day and the tasks they plan to work on today.\n\nWith access to all your activities, Pieces can help automate this process.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Pieces prioritizes activities based on how often workstream activities are captured. This means that documents or applications you spend more time on will be given higher priority in the response.\n</Callout>\n\nIf Pieces has access to calendar apps, the column or grid format might not be easily understood by AI, which can lead to confusing responses. You might get better results by adding your calendar apps to the list of disabled sources.\n\nUse some of these time-based example prompts to ask Pieces Copilot to provide accurate, relevant answers summarizing recent activities.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #1\">\n    “What was I working on yesterday?”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #2\">\n    “Give me a list of all the GitHub issues I was looking at yesterday in the Mustafar project.”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #3\">\n    “Summarize all the documents I was editing yesterday in Chrome and give me back a list of 5 bullet points that lists my main activities.”\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Get Next Steps\n\nPieces can detect any upcoming activities, such as tasks in a task management tool, emails in your inbox, or discussions around future work in chat tools.\n\nYou can then ask Pieces to summarize these to give you details on what your next priorities are.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #1\">\n    “What is next on my agenda?”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #2\">\n    “What are the tasks Luke asked me to look at?”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #3\">\n    “What tasks are still open in my to-do app?”\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Get Project History\n\nAs you work on multiple activities for a project, Pieces is able to piece together memories by capturing relevant context from multiple applications.\n\nThis allows you to prompt asking for information about a project and get a response that reasons over all these memories.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #1\">\n    “Summarize the carbonite freezing project and give me links to relevant documents.”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #2\">\n    “Who are the main contributors to project R2, and what are their email addresses?”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #3\">\n    “Give me an overview of the work done so far on D2, and what are the next steps?”\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Get a Summary of Project Status\n\nIf you are in a role where you are often receiving project updates and summaries, it can be hard to stay on top of them all.\n\nPieces can read these updates with you, and provide summaries or roll-ups as needed.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #1\">\n    “Give me a summary of all the status updates I received last week from Han, Cassian, and Shin.”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #2\">\n    “Write me a summary report on the status of the Phasma testing.”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #3\">\n    “Send me a list of all the Jira tickets mentioned in the Geonosis status updates channel in Teams.”\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Summarize Any Text Resource\n\nSometimes we come across different sources of information that might conflict or vary in detail. This could include anything from news articles to recommendations for code frameworks, cars, and more.\n\nTo help make sense of this and get a clearer understanding, Pieces can read all the sources with you, allowing you to think through these memories.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #1\">\n    “Summarize the 3 articles I was just reading about the recent stock market trends around AI.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #2\">\n    “I was just reading documentation on the best JavaScript framework to use. Provide me a detailed summary containing a list of all the frameworks, their pros and cons, and the maturity of each framework.”\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Prompt #3\">\n    “Based on the reviews of different SUVs I was just looking at in Edge, which one would be the best for a family of 3? I care most about the lowest environmental impact, and the best crash safety.”\n  </Step>\n</Steps>",

Ask, \"Give me the titles of all the project documents I've been working on,\" and you can specify a time range like \"last month.\" This helps find keywords for more specific prompts.\n</Callout>\n\n## Prompt by Time Range\n\nPieces stores up to 9 months of memories. To help narrow down the memories, you can include a time range in your prompt. This allows Pieces to focus on exactly what you need.\n\nFor example, you can ask, “What was I doing last week?” or “What were the plans I received from Scarif in December?”\n\n## Prompt by Source Application\n\nWhen Pieces captures memories, it also captures the application name that the memories came from—this allows you to ask specific questions related to the source application.\n\nTry using a prompt like “Summarize my discussions with Rey Skywalker in Teams” to separate conversations with a colleague in Teams from those in emails or document comments.\n\n## Mix Prompt Types\n\nThe more context Pieces has, the more it can narrow down to the right memories to use when responding to your prompts.\n\nYou can mix and match keywords, time ranges, and applications to get very accurate responses.\n\nAsk, “What is the URL for the Project Darklighter document I discussed in Teams with Biggs last Thursday?” This helps distinguish it from documents shared by others, in different apps, or at other times.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Prompt mixing is extremely useful—not only are you narrowing down the search by providing specific keywords, but you improve the accuracy of that search by also excluding other ranges or species of data.\n</Callout>\n\n## Use the Source and Time Range Filters\n\nIf you know the source application or time range you want to access in your prompts, a quick and accurate way to use them is through the filters.\n\nThis lets you filter by source applications or a time range using a set of predefined ranges or a custom picker. This method can be more accurate than using prompts because there are many ways to express time concepts.\n\n## Start New Copilot Chats When you Change Topic\n\nRule of thumb—if you change topic, start a new copilot chat.\n\nWhen you are in a Pieces Copilot chat, Pieces will extract the relevant memory context for the questions you ask, and use this across the entire conversation.\n\nIf you change topics, then the memories available in the chat may not be relevant, so you may get better results by starting a new chat.",

Once filtered, you can use these results as context for your chats.\n\n## In This Guide\n\nDiscover real-life use cases for the Workstream Activity view, and use it capture and filter entire project contexts, generate process documentation, and create detailed standup summaries using LTM roll-ups.\n\nPractical examples demonstrate how to turn these activity ‘snapshots’ into shareable references, from markdown exports to live discussions in Pieces Copilot chats, or search through them with various filters.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  Workstream Activities can be exported as markdown or raw text, then sent to another Pieces user, who can then add these as context to their own Pieces Copilot chat.\n</Callout>\n\n## Share All Context for a Project\n\nIf your project has a unique name, or other identifier that is easy to query for, then you can filter all Workstream Activities for that keyword—this will then give a historical overview of your activities with that project.\n\nOnce you have this, you can either open it all in a Pieces Copilot chat and have the LLM create a detailed summary report to share with someone else, or you can export and share the activities directly, either as markdown files, or as raw text.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/quick_guides/long_term_memory_prompting_guide/use_cases_for_the_pieces_workstream_activity_view/share_context_for_project.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Create a Summary To Document a Process\n\nWhen some folks are documenting a process, they often create a video which is shared with colleagues.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it misses important context, such as links or text from documentation, which must be shared separately and is difficult for the recipient to search.\n\nBy using Pieces, you can go through a process by checking documents, chats, emails, and code—then, you can create a new Workstream Activity for the time you spent.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/quick_guides/long_term_memory_prompting_guide/use_cases_for_the_pieces_workstream_activity_view/generating_summary_process.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nThis summary can be shared with your colleagues and will include text details like links to the documents you read, information about people involved in the conversations, links to code, and more.\n\n## Turn Summaries into PRs and Reports\n\nPieces can help you create a summary of completed work based on details like tickets. For instance, if you're a developer and need to participate in an asynchronous daily standup, you can use Pieces to create a summary of tickets resolved—deep-links included.\n\nYou can do this by going through your ticket system and reviewing all the tickets you worked on the previous day.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/quick_guides/long_term_memory_prompting_guide/use_cases_for_the_pieces_workstream_activity_view/all_github_issues_looked_at.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nThen, create a new Workstream Activity for the time you spent reviewing, which will include deep links to the tickets.

Download the correct PiecesOS file for your system’s architecture.\n\n2. From your **Downloads** folder, double-click the installed PiecesOS file to open it.\n\n3. Drag PiecesOS into the application folder if prompted, then open PiecesOS.\n\n### Configuring Permissions\n\nTwo permission prompts will pop up on your screen when installing PiecesOS.\n\n```markdown\nPiecesOS is an app downloaded from the internet. Are you sure you want to open it?\n```\n\nClick `Open` to continue with the installation.\n\nThen, you’ll see a second permissions pop-up message:\n\n```markdown\nPiecesOS is requesting to bypass the system private window picker and directly access your screen and audio. This will allow PiecesOS to record your screen and system audio, including personal or sensitive information that may be visible or audible.\n```\n\nClick `Allow`.\n\nThese permissions are required for [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os) to power the [Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2)](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2).\n\nPiecesOS will automatically open in your toolbar and pop up a *Notification preferences modal* in the upper right corner of your screen.\n\n### Enabling the LTM-2 Engine\n\nTo do this, open the PiecesOS Quick Menu and click `Enable Long-Term Memory Engine`.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/misc_fragments_media/macos_piecesOS_toolbar.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Install the Pieces for Raycast Extension\n\nIf this is your first time installing a Raycast extension, refer to [Raycast’s extension install guide](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/install-an-extension).\n\nTo install the Pieces Extension:\n\n1. Open **Raycast**\n\n2. Navigate to the **Raycast Store**\n\n3. Search for *“Pieces for Raycast”*\n\n4. Click `Install`\n\n### Launch and Use the Extension\n\nOnce the extension is installed on your device:\n\n1. Open Raycast\n\n2. Search for the command: `Search Saved Snippets`\n\n3. Use this command to browse and reuse your saved code\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  You can use a custom keyboard shortcut to quickly launch Raycast. See the [**Raycast Hotkey Manual** to learn more.](https://manual.raycast.com/hotkey)\n</Callout>\n\n## Features\n\nThe Raycast Extension lets you capture code snippets and other developer materials from multiple sources, reuse them on the fly, and manage your account without switching applications.\n\n## Pieces Drive\n\n[Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-drive) is your personal, intelligent snippet library—automatically curated and enriched as you work.\n\nIn the Raycast Extension, Pieces Drive serves as the backend engine that stores, indexes, and organizes the content you capture through various commands.\n\nBy integrating tightly with [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os), Pieces Drive ensures your saved materials are enriched with metadata like language, source, and context. This makes your content instantly searchable and more valuable over time as your snippet collection grows.\n\n### Search Saved Materials\n\nQuickly search across all of your saved code snippets using Raycast’s minimal interface.\n\nThis command surfaces results enriched with metadata such as title, language, tags, and source (e.g., clipboard, browser, editor). It’s a fast way to rediscover useful context you’ve captured in the past, without digging through files, emails, or browser tabs.\n\n<Image src=\"https://old.docs.pieces.app/assets/raycast/search_snippets.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nUse this feature when:\n\n* You want to reuse a snippet you saved earlier\n\n* You don’t remember exactly where you used it but recall its purpose\n\n* You want to avoid rewriting boilerplate or repeatedly googling common code\n\n### Save Clipboard History\n\nThis command displays a timeline of your clipboard history—enriched with metadata and usage context.\n\nYou can scroll through recently copied content and selectively save high-value items as persistent snippets. Each saved snippet includes its origin, content type, and timestamp, helping you retain the most relevant fragments of your workday.\n\n<Image src=\"https://old.docs.pieces.app/assets/raycast/save_clipboard_history.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Save Clipboard to Pieces\n\nYou can quickly save the current content in your clipboard to Pieces.\n\nThis command is perfect for moments when you quickly copy a block of code, a command, or a snippet of text and want to ensure its preservation.\n\n<Image src=\"https://old.docs.pieces.app/assets/raycast/save_clipboard.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Save Browser History to Pieces\n\nThis command allows you to surface code snippets that you recently interacted with in your browser, such as on Stack Overflow, GitHub, or blog posts.\n\nPieces identifies these snippets in your browser activity and gives you the option to save them with proper enrichment and metadata.\n\n<Image src=\"https://old.docs.pieces.app/assets/raycast/save_browser_history.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Save Finder Selection\n\nSelect one or more files in macOS Finder and save them to Pieces with a single command.\n\nFiles are stored as artifacts in your Pieces Library and enriched with metadata like filename, extension, and path.\n\n<Image src=\"https://old.docs.pieces.app/assets/raycast/save_finder_selection.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Save Selection in Any App\n\nHighlight any text in the currently active (frontmost) application—like VS Code, Terminal, Safari, or Slack—and instantly save it to Pieces.\n\nThis command enables frictionless, cross-app snippet capture without copy/paste.\n\n<Image src=\"https://old.docs.pieces.app/assets/raycast/save_frontmost_selection.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Account Access\n\nConnecting your Pieces account allows you to unlock the full potential of the ecosystem, including cloud sync, cross-device access, and personalized context enrichment.\n\nFrom within Raycast, you can quickly authenticate or sign out of your account to manage how your data is stored and accessed.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  While Pieces can be used fully offline, logging in enables advanced features such as secure backup, account-linked snippet history, and enhanced AI-powered enrichment.\n</Callout>\n\n### Sign-in to Pieces\n\nThis command securely authenticates your Pieces account from within Raycast, enabling cloud sync, cross-device access, and personalization features.\n\nOnce signed in, your saved snippets are backed up and available wherever Pieces is installed.\n\n<Image src=\"https://old.docs.pieces.app/assets/raycast/sign_in_to_pieces.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Sign out of Pieces\n\nLog out of your Pieces account from Raycast.\n\n<Image src=\"https://old.docs.pieces.app/assets/raycast/signout.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n  This is useful for switching accounts, temporarily disabling cloud syncing, or handing off a machine to another developer.\n</Callout>\n\n## Configuration\n\nWhile most of the configuration happens automatically, here are some helpful notes:\n\n* **PiecesOS must be running** for the Raycast Extension to function.\n\n* If you’re not signed in, use the `Sign into Pieces` command to authenticate.\n\n* Advanced features like auto-enrichment and snippet metadata rely on PiecesOS settings, which can be adjusted via the [Pieces Desktop App](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/configuration) or the [PiecesOS Toolbar.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nUse this section to diagnose problems, follow step-by-step fixes, and understand when to escalate an issue to the support team.\n\nPieces for Developers is built with resilience, but we know bugs can happen, and we’re here to help when they do.\n\n### Node.js Installation Screen Appears\n\nWhen you first use a Pieces command in Raycast, you may see a prompt to install Node.js. In some cases, this installation might fail or not complete.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Initial Attempt\">\n    Follow the on-screen prompts to install Node.js.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"If Installation Fails\">\n    Fully close Raycast, then reopen Raycast and try the command again.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"If the Issue Persists\">\n    Visit our [support page](https://docs.pieces.app/products/support) for help.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Data Privacy & Security\n\nAll data captured by the Raycast Extension is saved locally by default and never shared externally unless you explicitly enable cloud sync.\n\nYour clipboard contents, browser-captured snippets, and Finder selections are handled securely through PiecesOS.\n\nLearn more in our [Privacy Policy and Security Documentation.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/privacy-security-your-data)\n\n<on-device-storage />",

It can provide *hyper-specific* responses because it’s contextually aware of your workspace.\n\nTo do this, you can select the `Circled Plus` Icon in the bottom-left corner of your Copilot Chat window, which is openable from the extensions section of your browser.\n\nClick the `Circled Plus` icon**,** then add whatever context items you need.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/web_extension/pieces_copilot/chat/add_context_clicked.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Adding Code Snippets\n\nYou can paste code snippets as a code block in any Copilot Chat by clicking the `{ }` icon in the add context window and then pasting your code.\n\nThis helps add code that isn't currently in the active file as context, or for making comparisons and suggestions.\n\nYou can also locate a code snippet, i.e., on StackOverflow, and select the `Ask Copilot` that appears below it.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/web_extension/pieces_copilot/chat/add_context_snippet.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Extracting Code from Screenshots\n\nYou can extract code from screenshots directly in the Copilot chat menu by selecting `Extract Code from Screenshot`.\n\nChoose the screenshot from your **Finder** (macOS) or **File Explorer** (Windows/Linux) menu, and confirm your selection.\n\nPieces Copilot will scan the screenshot and generate the code from the image into the chat. You can then copy it, save it as a snippet, and more.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/web_extension/pieces_copilot/chat/extract_code_screenshot.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## AI Quick Actions\n\nBelow code blocks on websites, you can find a clickable `Ask Copilot` option that will allow you to ask Pieces Copilot directly about the code.\n\nClicking `Ask Copilot` will open the Pieces Copilot sidebar. The code will be explained within that chat, along with its purpose and function.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/web_extension/pieces_copilot/chat/ask_copilot_QA.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Improving Code Consistency & Standardization\n\nThe Pieces Copilot Chat helps you with coding and learning tasks to increase productivity and improve your workflow.\n\nIt achieves this by removing the need for **context-switching** (leaving your window to use generative AI).\n\n### Naming Inconsistencies\n\nSuppose functions across your workspace use inconsistent naming patterns (e.g., `authenticateUser` in `authHandler.go` vs. `retrieveUserProfile` in `userHandler.go`).\n\nIn that case, it is helpful to adopt a standardized naming convention for better readability and maintainability. You can find suggestions for such conventions in snippets available on the web, like this:\n\n```c\n// authHandler.go\nfunc authenticateUser(ctx context.Context, credentials Credentials) (User, error) {\n    if credentials.Username == \"\" || credentials.Password == \"\" {\n        return User{}, errors.New(\"missing credentials\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Inconsistent Error Handling\n\nIf error-handling strategies differ across web sources (e.g., structured errors in `authService.go` vs. inconsistent handling in `userService.go`), Pieces Copilot can help unify the approach:\n\n```c\n// authService.go\nfunc LoginUser(credentials Credentials) (string, error) {\n    token, err := authenticate(credentials)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"login failed: %w\", err)\n    }\n    return token, nil\n}\n```",

anytime, anywhere, and in any way you need.\n\nHere are some examples of developer materials you can reuse:\n\n***\n\n| `Logging Utilities`    | A helper function for detailed server-side logging with timestamps and error levels.                        | Speeds up debugging and monitoring by inserting reliable logging methods.   |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `Validation Functions` | A function to validate JSON payloads or form inputs before submission.                                      | Ensures data integrity with reusable, thoroughly tested validation logic.   |\n| `API Integration Code` | Prewritten `axios` code for making GET or POST requests, complete with error handling and response parsing. | Reduces repetitive work when integrating RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints. |\n| `Component Templates`  | A React functional component template with basic hooks and styling setup.                                   | Provides a consistent starting point for building new components.           |\n| `Database Queries`     | A MongoDB query to retrieve active user data filtered by last login.                                        | Streamlines database tasks by reusing optimized query patterns              |\n\n***\n\n## Boosting Productivity with Snippet Management\n\nThe Pieces Drive connects you with your notes and project files, allowing you to focus on what matters—building great software—while offering tools for efficient code reuse.\n\n* **Improved Productivity**: Concentrate on solving new problems instead of revisiting old ones by quickly accessing and reusing code snippets.\n\n* **Contextual Awareness**: Saved materials contain metadata, descriptions, and links to relevant searches, helping you remember their origin, purpose, and best usage scenarios.\n\n* **Code Standardization**: Sharing best practices and reusable components ensures consistent coding practices and conventions across teams and projects.\n\nBy using the Pieces Drive, you can capture and manage your snippets to streamline daily tasks and enhance your workflow in several ways:\n\n### Save & Organize\n\nEasily [save a function, script, or piece of boilerplate](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/save-snippets) directly from the tool menu.\n\nThese snippets are saved to your personal Pieces Drive and enriched with context, metadata, and tags, making them easy to find whenever needed.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/web_extension/pieces_drive/_MAIN/saved_media_browser.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nTo save a snippet in your browser, highlight a section of text or code, right-click, and select `Pieces: Save Selection`.\n\nOn websites with code blocks, Pieces will add a `Copy and Save` option below the block, saving the snippet to your Pieces Drive.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/web_extension/pieces_drive/_MAIN/save_QA.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n### Search & Reuse\n\nYou can directly [search your collection of saved materials in Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/search-reuse) from your browser to quickly find snippets by keyword or context.\n\nTo search, open the **Search Bar** from the Pieces Web extension sidebar in the Pieces Drive tab.\n\nType your query into the search bar and press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to view the search results.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/web_extension/pieces_drive/_MAIN/search_for_snippet.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\nAny related snippets will appear in the results list.\n\nFrom there, you can press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to view your snippet, complete with all its saved context, neatly displayed inside the editor.\n\n### Sharing\n\nShare your snippets from within the Pieces Web Extension, even if the person you’re sending it to doesn’t use Pieces or have a Pieces for Developers account.\n\n<Card title=\"Use Case\" image=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1745331050120/37d8601f-8136-45e4-b353-c6d37d69f976.png\">\n  Sharing useful code snippets can help overcome productivity hurdles, especially if a co-developer is new to the project or is a junior developer.\n\n  For instance, a teammate working on server monitoring can use your shared script to automate daily tasks without extra setup.\n\n  These shared links also keep their [original enriched metadata](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet), including tags, descriptions, and other details, making it easier for teammates to understand and use the code.\n</Card>\n\nTo share a snippet from your browser, simply find a code block you want to share and click the `Share` quick action below it.\n\nYou can also locate a snippet in your Pieces Drive, right click it, and select `Generate Shareable Link`.\n\nThis generates a link you can share with teammates, ensuring easy access to your reusable code.\n\n<Image src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/web_extension/pieces_drive/_MAIN/shared_snippet.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" fullwidth=\"true\" />\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWith the Pieces Web Extension, [your snippets become a powerful library](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) of reusable code. You can organize, search, edit, and share them across your projects, all within the Pieces Drive.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use them:\n\n### Reusable Code Snippets for Data Science\n\nIf you often work on complex data science projects, algorithm design, or data processing pipelines, you can save reusable code snippets in your Pieces Drive.\n\nThese snippets can be easily imported into your browser for documenting workflows, analyzing results, and iterating on solutions in future projects.\n\n```python\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  \n\ndata.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  \n \nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler  \nscaler = MinMaxScaler()  \ndata[['feature1', 'feature2']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['feature1', 'feature2']])  \n\nprint(data.describe())  \n```\n\n### Code Snippet Documentation\n\nIf you frequently research projects that involve monitoring file system changes, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/save-snippets) that does exactly that, allowing you to import it over to your IDE for usage:\n\n```go\nfunc watchFileChanges(path string) {\n\twatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer watcher.Close()\n\n\terr = watcher.Add(path)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase event := <-watcher.Events:\n\t\t\tif event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Modified file:\", event.Name)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tcase err := <-watcher.Errors:\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Testing Framework Templates\">\n    Streamline testing by saving snippets for your frequently used testing functions or unit test templates.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Command-Line Utilities\">\n    Save command-line instructions as snippets to quickly retrieve deployment commands, Docker setups, and other essential terminal operations.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Error Handling & Logging\">\n    You can also save common logging functions or error-handling snippets that can be reused across applications, promoting consistent error management.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Quickly Create New Projects\">\n    Import saved setup scripts, configuration files, and commonly used dependencies to speed up project setup and ensure consistency across new projects.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>",
